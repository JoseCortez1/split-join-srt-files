30454
19:17:02,320 --> 19:17:06,800
cryptic and uninteresting URL notice at

30455
19:17:05,040 --> 19:17:10,280
the very end of it and I'll zoom in in a

30456
19:17:06,800 --> 19:17:12,640
moment what do you see slh hello.html

30457
19:17:10,280 --> 19:17:15,120
which follows the convention I claimed

30458
19:17:12,640 --> 19:17:17,872
before break is how a browser would

30459
19:17:15,120 --> 19:17:20,400
allow you to to access a specific file

30460
19:17:17,872 --> 19:17:22,360
on a server by doing slash and then the

30461
19:17:20,400 --> 19:17:24,159
name of the file name everything before

30462
19:17:22,360 --> 19:17:26,280
it is very cryptic it would be better if

30463
19:17:24,160 --> 19:17:28,120
I you know uh buy a domain name that's a

30464
19:17:26,280 --> 19:17:29,760
little more easy to remember and set

30465
19:17:28,120 --> 19:17:31,680
that up some other time but for now

30466
19:17:29,760 --> 19:17:34,832
let's just focus on only the file names

30467
19:17:31,680 --> 19:17:37,280
that I'm actually creating all right so

30468
19:17:34,832 --> 19:17:39,400
the code is up and running underwhelming

30469
19:17:37,280 --> 19:17:41,280
though it might be with the body in the

30470
19:17:39,400 --> 19:17:43,760
middle of the page and let me zoom in up

30471
19:17:41,280 --> 19:17:46,120
here too hello comma title is indeed in

30472
19:17:43,760 --> 19:17:48,159
the tab just as promised so what's

30473
19:17:46,120 --> 19:17:49,720
actually going on with code like this

30474
19:17:48,160 --> 19:17:51,720
that we just created well let's go back

30475
19:17:49,720 --> 19:17:53,600
to the slide version of the same and let

30476
19:17:51,720 --> 19:17:55,000
me just highlight a few of these lines

30477
19:17:53,600 --> 19:17:57,512
the very first line is what's called

30478
19:17:55,000 --> 19:17:58,920
your document type declaration doesn't

30479
19:17:57,512 --> 19:18:00,680
really matter to remember that by

30480
19:17:58,920 --> 19:18:02,640
phrasing and this is just something you

30481
19:18:00,680 --> 19:18:04,959
copy paste or do from memory at the top

30482
19:18:02,640 --> 19:18:08,192
of any HTML file that you create when

30483
19:18:04,960 --> 19:18:09,960
making your own web page it's a implicit

30484
19:18:08,192 --> 19:18:12,120
indicator to the browser that you're

30485
19:18:09,960 --> 19:18:13,920
using the very latest version of HTML

30486
19:18:12,120 --> 19:18:15,640
which is version five you don't mention

30487
19:18:13,920 --> 19:18:17,360
the number five just browsers now

30488
19:18:15,640 --> 19:18:19,040
nowadays are program to look for this to

30489
19:18:17,360 --> 19:18:21,160
know that you're using the very latest

30490
19:18:19,040 --> 19:18:23,640
version of the language languages just

30491
19:18:21,160 --> 19:18:25,680
like human languages evolve over time

30492
19:18:23,640 --> 19:18:27,400
we're up to version five of HTML but new

30493
19:18:25,680 --> 19:18:29,192
features get added every few years so

30494
19:18:27,400 --> 19:18:31,360
indeed this lecture this class has been

30495
19:18:29,192 --> 19:18:33,599
evolving over time too so let's now

30496
19:18:31,360 --> 19:18:35,160
focus on the next line as well as the

30497
19:18:33,600 --> 19:18:37,760
bottom line and you'll notice some

30498
19:18:35,160 --> 19:18:39,872
deliberate symmetry here this here is

30499
19:18:37,760 --> 19:18:41,120
what we're going to call a tag and it's

30500
19:18:39,872 --> 19:18:42,600
technically different from this this is

30501
19:18:41,120 --> 19:18:44,192
a document type declaration it's got the

30502
19:18:42,600 --> 19:18:46,680
weird exclamation point that's the only

30503
19:18:44,192 --> 19:18:50,040
anomaly everything else follows pattern

30504
19:18:46,680 --> 19:18:53,719
this is a tag in HTML and it's the HTML

30505
19:18:50,040 --> 19:18:56,959
tag and a tag generally both starts and

30506
19:18:53,720 --> 19:18:59,040
stops or opens and closes at some point

30507
19:18:56,960 --> 19:19:01,232
so this is the so-called start tag or

30508
19:18:59,040 --> 19:19:03,040
open tag and this just means essentially

30509
19:19:01,232 --> 19:19:04,960
to the browser hey browser here comes

30510
19:19:03,040 --> 19:19:07,120
some HTML the language in which web

30511
19:19:04,960 --> 19:19:10,192
pages are written this here with the

30512
19:19:07,120 --> 19:19:12,440
forward slash after the angled bracket

30513
19:19:10,192 --> 19:19:13,832
means hey browser that's it for the HTML

30514
19:19:12,440 --> 19:19:15,720
of this page so that's what I mean by

30515
19:19:13,832 --> 19:19:17,511
symmetry I started a thought here

30516
19:19:15,720 --> 19:19:20,512
finished it down here what's in between

30517
19:19:17,512 --> 19:19:22,360
those two thoughts well here browser or

30518
19:19:20,512 --> 19:19:25,360
rather let me clarify one thing this

30519
19:19:22,360 --> 19:19:27,680
thing here is that other uh keyword an

30520
19:19:25,360 --> 19:19:30,120
attribute an attribute is something that

30521
19:19:27,680 --> 19:19:32,871
modifies the behavior of a tag so it's

30522
19:19:30,120 --> 19:19:34,799
similar to an argument in C or in Python

30523
19:19:32,872 --> 19:19:36,280
like a parameter to a function these

30524
19:19:34,800 --> 19:19:38,400
aren't functions but it's the same idea

30525
19:19:36,280 --> 19:19:40,872
it just modifies the default behavior of

30526
19:19:38,400 --> 19:19:42,360
something instead Lang equals you can

30527
19:19:40,872 --> 19:19:44,680
probably guess just means that hey

30528
19:19:42,360 --> 19:19:46,480
browser assume that everything Hereafter

30529
19:19:44,680 --> 19:19:48,680
is in English and that might be useful

30530
19:19:46,480 --> 19:19:50,360
for like Google translate or just search

30531
19:19:48,680 --> 19:19:52,552
engine optimization so that just the

30532
19:19:50,360 --> 19:19:54,600
server the browser know like what human

30533
19:19:52,552 --> 19:19:56,599
language you have actual content in like

30534
19:19:54,600 --> 19:19:58,320
hello title hello body even though a

30535
19:19:56,600 --> 19:20:00,680
good computer can probably infer from

30536
19:19:58,320 --> 19:20:03,192
Context often all right so that's an

30537
19:20:00,680 --> 19:20:05,231
attribute that's a tag and the whole

30538
19:20:03,192 --> 19:20:07,760
thing here everything in between the

30539
19:20:05,232 --> 19:20:09,832
start tag and end tag we would also call

30540
19:20:07,760 --> 19:20:12,599
an HTML element that just means

30541
19:20:09,832 --> 19:20:15,599
everything related to that open and

30542
19:20:12,600 --> 19:20:18,280
close tag all right now notice indented

30543
19:20:15,600 --> 19:20:20,872
inside of so to speak the HTML open and

30544
19:20:18,280 --> 19:20:23,040
close tag are another pair of tags the

30545
19:20:20,872 --> 19:20:24,920
head tag and the body tag or the head

30546
19:20:23,040 --> 19:20:26,920
element collectively and the body

30547
19:20:24,920 --> 19:20:28,640
element collectively and same idea hey

30548
19:20:26,920 --> 19:20:30,232
browser here comes the head of my page

30549
19:20:28,640 --> 19:20:31,800
hey browser that's it for the head hey

30550
19:20:30,232 --> 19:20:34,080
browser here comes the body of my page

30551
19:20:31,800 --> 19:20:36,160
hey browser that's it for the body the

30552
19:20:34,080 --> 19:20:38,640
head is essentially the tiny little

30553
19:20:36,160 --> 19:20:41,552
strip at the very top including the tab

30554
19:20:38,640 --> 19:20:43,120
itself the body is like 95% of

30555
19:20:41,552 --> 19:20:45,040
everything else the big rectangular

30556
19:20:43,120 --> 19:20:47,480
region what's inside of your title at

30557
19:20:45,040 --> 19:20:49,511
the at of your head of the web page at

30558
19:20:47,480 --> 19:20:51,120
the moment just the title so this

30559
19:20:49,512 --> 19:20:52,920
indicates hey browser Here Comes My

30560
19:20:51,120 --> 19:20:54,920
Title hey browser that's it for the

30561
19:20:52,920 --> 19:20:57,599
title the title of course is literally

30562
19:20:54,920 --> 19:20:59,832
quote unquote hello comma title

30563
19:20:57,600 --> 19:21:03,120
meanwhile if we bounce back out here is

30564
19:20:59,832 --> 19:21:05,231
the uh second element inside of the HTML

30565
19:21:03,120 --> 19:21:06,760
tag uh this says Hey browser here comes

30566
19:21:05,232 --> 19:21:08,480
the body hey browser that's it for the

30567
19:21:06,760 --> 19:21:10,280
body and hey browser this is the

30568
19:21:08,480 --> 19:21:12,640
contents these are the contents of the

30569
19:21:10,280 --> 19:21:14,680
body itself now the indentation is a

30570
19:21:12,640 --> 19:21:17,232
stylistic thing I did it just to be sort

30571
19:21:14,680 --> 19:21:19,439
of neat and en TIY because it suggests

30572
19:21:17,232 --> 19:21:21,960
what is inside of what but it also

30573
19:21:19,440 --> 19:21:23,600
suggests a sort of hierarchy and in fact

30574
19:21:21,960 --> 19:21:26,440
we'll use terminology from like the

30575
19:21:23,600 --> 19:21:29,832
world of family trees if this is like a

30576
19:21:26,440 --> 19:21:33,000
parent so to speak head and body would

30577
19:21:29,832 --> 19:21:35,720
be the child elements of the HTML tag

30578
19:21:33,000 --> 19:21:37,760
meanwhile title is a child of the head

30579
19:21:35,720 --> 19:21:39,872
tag or equivalently tital is a

30580
19:21:37,760 --> 19:21:42,000
grandchild of HTML so you can use the

30581
19:21:39,872 --> 19:21:44,192
same sort of vernacular as in the human

30582
19:21:42,000 --> 19:21:45,872
world when it comes to uh familial

30583
19:21:44,192 --> 19:21:48,871
relationships too and that just H set

30584
19:21:45,872 --> 19:21:52,760
again the same hierarchy so we have tags

30585
19:21:48,872 --> 19:21:55,080
and they include HTML head title body

30586
19:21:52,760 --> 19:21:57,640
and that's it for now we have attributes

30587
19:21:55,080 --> 19:21:59,160
we've seen one example of them Lang but

30588
19:21:57,640 --> 19:22:01,040
we'll see many other examples of the

30589
19:21:59,160 --> 19:22:03,160
same idea but these building blocks are

30590
19:22:01,040 --> 19:22:04,280
exactly the same generally you start a

30591
19:22:03,160 --> 19:22:06,800
thought you finish a thought and you

30592
19:22:04,280 --> 19:22:10,480
might do something in between questions

30593
19:22:06,800 --> 19:22:12,920
on this basic structure of any web

30594
19:22:10,480 --> 19:22:16,231
page any questions at

30595
19:22:12,920 --> 19:22:17,640
all no all right so let's now now allow

30596
19:22:16,232 --> 19:22:19,600
things to ramp up a little more

30597
19:22:17,640 --> 19:22:21,400
interestingly and do something with

30598
19:22:19,600 --> 19:22:22,960
these building blocks but so that you

30599
19:22:21,400 --> 19:22:25,079
have a mental model for everything

30600
19:22:22,960 --> 19:22:28,232
that's going on here on after think of

30601
19:22:25,080 --> 19:22:29,872
this same HTML being related in spirit

30602
19:22:28,232 --> 19:22:32,280
to week five when we talked all about

30603
19:22:29,872 --> 19:22:33,640
data structures if I really wanted to I

30604
19:22:32,280 --> 19:22:36,280
could take to heart this idea of

30605
19:22:33,640 --> 19:22:38,280
children and parents and grandparents

30606
19:22:36,280 --> 19:22:40,680
and really depict this thing graphically

30607
19:22:38,280 --> 19:22:42,360
and in fact this tree here if you will

30608
19:22:40,680 --> 19:22:44,959
and it's not a binary tree it's not a

30609
19:22:42,360 --> 19:22:47,360
binary search tree it's just a tree uh

30610
19:22:44,960 --> 19:22:49,192
used week five's terminology if this

30611
19:22:47,360 --> 19:22:51,512
special node here represents the whole

30612
19:22:49,192 --> 19:22:54,552
document well the root element as I

30613
19:22:51,512 --> 19:22:57,040
called it is HTML HTML has two children

30614
19:22:54,552 --> 19:23:00,319
head and body the head tag has in turn a

30615
19:22:57,040 --> 19:23:02,511
title uh child and in turn has some text

30616
19:23:00,320 --> 19:23:04,440
just as the body has some text and so

30617
19:23:02,512 --> 19:23:06,960
this is what your browser is doing you

30618
19:23:04,440 --> 19:23:09,000
and I the programmers write this stuff

30619
19:23:06,960 --> 19:23:10,400
the browser reads this code top to

30620
19:23:09,000 --> 19:23:12,800
bottom left to right whenever you visit

30621
19:23:10,400 --> 19:23:15,159
a website and inside of the computer's

30622
19:23:12,800 --> 19:23:17,760
memory Chrome Edge Firefox Safari what

30623
19:23:15,160 --> 19:23:20,232
what not they build this data structure

30624
19:23:17,760 --> 19:23:22,280
in the computer's memory so as to know

30625
19:23:20,232 --> 19:23:24,280
what it is you have told them to do and

30626
19:23:22,280 --> 19:23:25,959
we'll see over time at the end of today

30627
19:23:24,280 --> 19:23:28,232
you can write code in an actual

30628
19:23:25,960 --> 19:23:30,192
programming language JavaScript to maybe

30629
19:23:28,232 --> 19:23:32,080
dynamically add or remove things from

30630
19:23:30,192 --> 19:23:33,920
this tree and this is how things like

30631
19:23:32,080 --> 19:23:36,120
Gmail work when you open up your Gmail

30632
19:23:33,920 --> 19:23:37,512
inbox if you're a Gmail user if you just

30633
19:23:36,120 --> 19:23:39,599
stay there long enough you'll probably

30634
19:23:37,512 --> 19:23:41,440
get more and more mail and what happens

30635
19:23:39,600 --> 19:23:43,960
you don't have to like reload the page

30636
19:23:41,440 --> 19:23:45,600
or rebuild the tree per se it just all

30637
19:23:43,960 --> 19:23:47,832
of a sudden appears at the top

30638
19:23:45,600 --> 19:23:49,832
at the top at the top what's happening

30639
19:23:47,832 --> 19:23:52,120
there is that Google wrote some code

30640
19:23:49,832 --> 19:23:54,040
that just keeps adding more nodes to

30641
19:23:52,120 --> 19:23:55,760
this tree every time they realize you've

30642
19:23:54,040 --> 19:23:58,280
got a new message again and again so

30643
19:23:55,760 --> 19:24:00,760
that's the relationship now even with

30644
19:23:58,280 --> 19:24:03,360
this world of HTML with all of the

30645
19:24:00,760 --> 19:24:05,319
programmatic ideas we looked at in the

30646
19:24:03,360 --> 19:24:07,120
past all right so let's go ahead and do

30647
19:24:05,320 --> 19:24:09,120
something with this that's a little more

30648
19:24:07,120 --> 19:24:10,599
interesting than just hello itself I'm

30649
19:24:09,120 --> 19:24:12,760
going to go ahead and hide my terminal

30650
19:24:10,600 --> 19:24:14,440
window because the server is now running

30651
19:24:12,760 --> 19:24:17,400
and all I want to do now is experiment

30652
19:24:14,440 --> 19:24:19,720
with uh hello and other examples as well

30653
19:24:17,400 --> 19:24:23,640
let me go ahead and actually before I do

30654
19:24:19,720 --> 19:24:25,720
that let me go ahead and run uh code of

30655
19:24:23,640 --> 19:24:27,280
paragraphs. HTML just so I can keep my

30656
19:24:25,720 --> 19:24:29,960
code separate and now I'll hide the

30657
19:24:27,280 --> 19:24:32,400
terminal window again um paragraphs.

30658
19:24:29,960 --> 19:24:34,872
HTML I'm going to do almost exactly the

30659
19:24:32,400 --> 19:24:37,000
same let me go ahead and start with

30660
19:24:34,872 --> 19:24:38,720
something familiar and eventually I'll

30661
19:24:37,000 --> 19:24:42,080
start copying and pasting just to save

30662
19:24:38,720 --> 19:24:44,360
time so doc type HTML is always there

30663
19:24:42,080 --> 19:24:46,232
open the HTML tag and now notice I

30664
19:24:44,360 --> 19:24:48,600
didn't type the rest of that just like

30665
19:24:46,232 --> 19:24:50,320
with C just like with python we try to

30666
19:24:48,600 --> 19:24:52,760
save you some keystrokes by closing

30667
19:24:50,320 --> 19:24:54,512
parentheses adding quotes the HTML

30668
19:24:52,760 --> 19:24:56,159
support in VSS code is pretty good too

30669
19:24:54,512 --> 19:24:58,552
and it tries to finish your thought when

30670
19:24:56,160 --> 19:25:00,160
it comes to tags as well it can screw

30671
19:24:58,552 --> 19:25:01,552
things up if you if it does something

30672
19:25:00,160 --> 19:25:02,680
you don't want it to do so sometimes you

30673
19:25:01,552 --> 19:25:05,040
have to delete but it's just

30674
19:25:02,680 --> 19:25:06,871
autocomplete as we've seen before uh

30675
19:25:05,040 --> 19:25:09,360
let's go ahead and let me add Lang

30676
19:25:06,872 --> 19:25:12,400
equals as all of my examples today will

30677
19:25:09,360 --> 19:25:15,080
be let's add the head tag let's go and

30678
19:25:12,400 --> 19:25:17,680
proactively add the body tag and now

30679
19:25:15,080 --> 19:25:19,800
let's go ahead and give this a title tag

30680
19:25:17,680 --> 19:25:21,480
uh which has a I'll just call this

30681
19:25:19,800 --> 19:25:23,640
paragraphs just so I remember which

30682
19:25:21,480 --> 19:25:25,080
example is what now notice all of this

30683
19:25:23,640 --> 19:25:27,512
white space and all of this neat and

30684
19:25:25,080 --> 19:25:29,000
tidy indentation the browser ultimately

30685
19:25:27,512 --> 19:25:31,040
is not going to care about this is just

30686
19:25:29,000 --> 19:25:32,552
for us humans to kind of keep ourselves

30687
19:25:31,040 --> 19:25:34,552
saying when we look at the code it's

30688
19:25:32,552 --> 19:25:37,440
just easier to read but strictly

30689
19:25:34,552 --> 19:25:39,599
speaking I could minimally delete all of

30690
19:25:37,440 --> 19:25:42,232
this white space and I could just move

30691
19:25:39,600 --> 19:25:43,680
all of this tag up to the same line both

30692
19:25:42,232 --> 19:25:45,480
I think are fine I'll just going to

30693
19:25:43,680 --> 19:25:47,599
follow a certain convention but this too

30694
19:25:45,480 --> 19:25:49,360
would have the exact same meaning but

30695
19:25:47,600 --> 19:25:50,832
we'll see where that detail about whites

30696
19:25:49,360 --> 19:25:53,320
space could potentially get us into

30697
19:25:50,832 --> 19:25:56,159
trouble later in my paragraphs tag let's

30698
19:25:53,320 --> 19:25:58,320
do this in advance I've written up some

30699
19:25:56,160 --> 19:26:00,000
Latin like text a really long paragraph

30700
19:25:58,320 --> 19:26:01,552
of Latin like text like this it's

30701
19:26:00,000 --> 19:26:02,920
actually random nonsense it's not real

30702
19:26:01,552 --> 19:26:05,599
Latin even though a couple of the words

30703
19:26:02,920 --> 19:26:07,400
might look familiar and so here we have

30704
19:26:05,600 --> 19:26:09,640
three paragraphs of text and I've

30705
19:26:07,400 --> 19:26:11,319
deliberately hit enter in between them

30706
19:26:09,640 --> 19:26:12,760
so that just like an essay in Google

30707
19:26:11,320 --> 19:26:15,080
Docs or Microsoft Word hopefully I'll

30708
19:26:12,760 --> 19:26:17,640
see three separate paragraphs let me now

30709
19:26:15,080 --> 19:26:20,120
change tabs and I'll close hello.html

30710
19:26:17,640 --> 19:26:22,360
from before I'm going to go back to my

30711
19:26:20,120 --> 19:26:25,040
other tab here I'm going to click back

30712
19:26:22,360 --> 19:26:27,640
to go back to that index of all of my

30713
19:26:25,040 --> 19:26:29,000
files which I started at earlier and

30714
19:26:27,640 --> 19:26:30,232
you'll see now that I have two files

30715
19:26:29,000 --> 19:26:32,720
because I obviously just created a

30716
19:26:30,232 --> 19:26:34,280
second file called paragraphs. HTML so

30717
19:26:32,720 --> 19:26:37,960
let's click on this to see our three

30718
19:26:34,280 --> 19:26:41,280
paragraphs of Latin like text and voila

30719
19:26:37,960 --> 19:26:43,512
I'll zoom out all right first bug if you

30720
19:26:41,280 --> 19:26:47,600
will this just looks like one massive

30721
19:26:43,512 --> 19:26:50,280
blob of text not three Blobs of text and

30722
19:26:47,600 --> 19:26:51,960
why might that be borrowing the the hint

30723
19:26:50,280 --> 19:26:55,640
I offered a moment

30724
19:26:51,960 --> 19:26:57,552
ago why are we not seeing break yeah so

30725
19:26:55,640 --> 19:26:58,920
we need some kind of line breaks here

30726
19:26:57,552 --> 19:27:00,231
because the browser turns out is only

30727
19:26:58,920 --> 19:27:01,680
going to take us literally and if you

30728
19:27:00,232 --> 19:27:03,760
just give it text text text it's just

30729
19:27:01,680 --> 19:27:05,832
going to show you text and anytime

30730
19:27:03,760 --> 19:27:08,959
there's more than a single white space

30731
19:27:05,832 --> 19:27:10,319
whether it's two or 20 or 200 it's going

30732
19:27:08,960 --> 19:27:11,800
to just assume that you did that just to

30733
19:27:10,320 --> 19:27:13,872
be neat and tidy and it's going to

30734
19:27:11,800 --> 19:27:16,120
collapse them into just one space

30735
19:27:13,872 --> 19:27:19,040
visually like this so there are in fact

30736
19:27:16,120 --> 19:27:20,871
a couple of solutions one is this here I

30737
19:27:19,040 --> 19:27:23,832
could add some explicit line breaks and

30738
19:27:20,872 --> 19:27:26,040
it turns out that there's a br tag like

30739
19:27:23,832 --> 19:27:27,871
this and just for uh visibility sake let

30740
19:27:26,040 --> 19:27:30,439
me do two of them so like hitting enter

30741
19:27:27,872 --> 19:27:32,960
enter on my keyboard I'll do it here too

30742
19:27:30,440 --> 19:27:35,120
BR for break break and now let me go

30743
19:27:32,960 --> 19:27:37,080
back to my other tab nothing's changed

30744
19:27:35,120 --> 19:27:38,871
yet but that's because I have to reload

30745
19:27:37,080 --> 19:27:40,320
I've changed it on the server but now I

30746
19:27:38,872 --> 19:27:42,160
need to change it in the browser by

30747
19:27:40,320 --> 19:27:44,480
reloading and now it looks a little

30748
19:27:42,160 --> 19:27:48,040
better albeit nonsensical but you'll

30749
19:27:44,480 --> 19:27:49,800
know is a curiosity per this BR tag this

30750
19:27:48,040 --> 19:27:51,832
is kind of poorly designed it's a little

30751
19:27:49,800 --> 19:27:54,920
hackish to just say enter enter and make

30752
19:27:51,832 --> 19:27:57,799
the browser do this breaks line breaks

30753
19:27:54,920 --> 19:28:00,552
don't actually require Clos tags or end

30754
19:27:57,800 --> 19:28:02,120
tags so not all tags need to be closed

30755
19:28:00,552 --> 19:28:03,760
at least those that it just makes no

30756
19:28:02,120 --> 19:28:06,231
semantic sense to close them right like

30757
19:28:03,760 --> 19:28:08,192
the break is there or it's not you can't

30758
19:28:06,232 --> 19:28:09,680
imagine like starting to move to the

30759
19:28:08,192 --> 19:28:11,080
next line and then eventually getting

30760
19:28:09,680 --> 19:28:13,480
around to finishing like it's either

30761
19:28:11,080 --> 19:28:15,920
there or it's not so some tags do not

30762
19:28:13,480 --> 19:28:18,120
have closed tags as necessary but

30763
19:28:15,920 --> 19:28:20,319
there's a more elegant way here I dare

30764
19:28:18,120 --> 19:28:22,159
say not just sort of hackish putting in

30765
19:28:20,320 --> 19:28:24,600
these line breaks let me do this instead

30766
19:28:22,160 --> 19:28:26,872
I'll delete those and let me go ahead

30767
19:28:24,600 --> 19:28:29,400
and as the name of this file suggests

30768
19:28:26,872 --> 19:28:31,232
let me add a paragraph tag now here I

30769
19:28:29,400 --> 19:28:32,319
need to fight with vs codes autocomplete

30770
19:28:31,232 --> 19:28:34,480
because I don't want to finish the

30771
19:28:32,320 --> 19:28:36,552
sentence uh the thought there let me go

30772
19:28:34,480 --> 19:28:38,231
ahead and open the paragraph tag and

30773
19:28:36,552 --> 19:28:40,832
close a paragraph tag and just to keep

30774
19:28:38,232 --> 19:28:42,192
things tidy I'll go ahead and indent two

30775
19:28:40,832 --> 19:28:43,959
even though the indentation itself

30776
19:28:42,192 --> 19:28:46,319
doesn't matter let me go ahead and

30777
19:28:43,960 --> 19:28:49,400
create another tag for opening this

30778
19:28:46,320 --> 19:28:51,040
paragraph and I'll close this one here

30779
19:28:49,400 --> 19:28:52,511
and now let me see sometimes it's

30780
19:28:51,040 --> 19:28:53,959
fighting with my auto complete but

30781
19:28:52,512 --> 19:28:56,720
that's fine because I did this sort of

30782
19:28:53,960 --> 19:28:59,872
the wrong way at first and now let me go

30783
19:28:56,720 --> 19:29:01,872
ahead and finish this thought by closing

30784
19:28:59,872 --> 19:29:04,480
this paragraph tag here and I've

30785
19:29:01,872 --> 19:29:07,000
manually fixed all of my indentation so

30786
19:29:04,480 --> 19:29:09,040
now on line 10 I have the equivalent of

30787
19:29:07,000 --> 19:29:11,160
hey browser start a paragraph and then

30788
19:29:09,040 --> 19:29:12,920
it does the Latin like text then on line

30789
19:29:11,160 --> 19:29:15,640
12 hey browser that's it for this

30790
19:29:12,920 --> 19:29:19,360
paragraph and repeat repeat repeat if I

30791
19:29:15,640 --> 19:29:21,720
now go back to my other Tab and reload

30792
19:29:19,360 --> 19:29:23,720
again shouldn't be all that different

30793
19:29:21,720 --> 19:29:25,552
but semantically it's a little bit

30794
19:29:23,720 --> 19:29:27,600
better why because just saying break

30795
19:29:25,552 --> 19:29:30,360
break doesn't really mean anything but

30796
19:29:27,600 --> 19:29:31,832
by saying paragraph paragraph paragraph

30797
19:29:30,360 --> 19:29:33,960
now there's some more semantic

30798
19:29:31,832 --> 19:29:36,280
information there now if like Google is

30799
19:29:33,960 --> 19:29:37,760
analyzing your page or if the programmer

30800
19:29:36,280 --> 19:29:39,600
is trying to understand what it is you

30801
19:29:37,760 --> 19:29:41,439
did in the past when writing this code

30802
19:29:39,600 --> 19:29:42,960
you just know semantically oh this is a

30803
19:29:41,440 --> 19:29:44,832
paragraph This is a paragraph This is a

30804
19:29:42,960 --> 19:29:46,512
paragraph just like in a book or or an

30805
19:29:44,832 --> 19:29:49,040
essay so it's a little more clear

30806
19:29:46,512 --> 19:29:52,640
focusing more on what it is not how you

30807
19:29:49,040 --> 19:29:54,832
want to display it any questions then on

30808
19:29:52,640 --> 19:29:57,040
these

30809
19:29:54,832 --> 19:29:58,599
paragraphs now all right so a few more

30810
19:29:57,040 --> 19:30:00,360
tags and indeed these first few examples

30811
19:29:58,600 --> 19:30:01,920
will really just be like sort of bang

30812
19:30:00,360 --> 19:30:03,512
bang bang just a bunch of different

30813
19:30:01,920 --> 19:30:05,000
vocabulary words in the form of these

30814
19:30:03,512 --> 19:30:06,760
new tags but we won't go through the

30815
19:30:05,000 --> 19:30:08,000
entire laundry list of tags this is

30816
19:30:06,760 --> 19:30:09,360
indeed the thing for which web

30817
19:30:08,000 --> 19:30:10,920
references and books and the like are

30818
19:30:09,360 --> 19:30:12,512
ultimately helpful just like a

30819
19:30:10,920 --> 19:30:13,832
dictionary in the real world so I'm

30820
19:30:12,512 --> 19:30:16,000
going to go ahead and do this let me go

30821
19:30:13,832 --> 19:30:18,720
ahead and copy this let me create a new

30822
19:30:16,000 --> 19:30:20,832
file called headings. HTML just so we

30823
19:30:18,720 --> 19:30:22,320
have a new file for this to save time

30824
19:30:20,832 --> 19:30:24,120
I'm just going to paste that exact same

30825
19:30:22,320 --> 19:30:25,960
code just to get me started I'm going to

30826
19:30:24,120 --> 19:30:28,319
change the title of it for clarity for

30827
19:30:25,960 --> 19:30:30,832
the code online to headings and now just

30828
19:30:28,320 --> 19:30:32,832
like a book or an essay or a thesis let

30829
19:30:30,832 --> 19:30:34,959
me actually put some actual headings

30830
19:30:32,832 --> 19:30:37,280
here now if my first heading like

30831
19:30:34,960 --> 19:30:39,080
chapter one I could do something like

30832
19:30:37,280 --> 19:30:40,640
this up here I could have a paragraph

30833
19:30:39,080 --> 19:30:43,080
like I just learned and I could say

30834
19:30:40,640 --> 19:30:44,800
something like chapter one here but

30835
19:30:43,080 --> 19:30:46,680
that's not really a paragraph and so

30836
19:30:44,800 --> 19:30:48,512
it's sort of better designed to tell the

30837
19:30:46,680 --> 19:30:50,319
browser and really tell the world what

30838
19:30:48,512 --> 19:30:53,192
it is so it turns out there's another

30839
19:30:50,320 --> 19:30:55,480
tag I can use like H1 for heading and

30840
19:30:53,192 --> 19:30:56,599
like most important heading and in here

30841
19:30:55,480 --> 19:30:58,231
I'm just going to keep it simple and I'm

30842
19:30:56,600 --> 19:30:59,720
going to say something like one and in

30843
19:30:58,232 --> 19:31:01,232
fact this is so short here's a good

30844
19:30:59,720 --> 19:31:03,512
candidate for just keeping this all on

30845
19:31:01,232 --> 19:31:05,120
the same line but this has no functional

30846
19:31:03,512 --> 19:31:07,360
difference but it'll just make it a

30847
19:31:05,120 --> 19:31:09,720
little tur more tur on the screen now

30848
19:31:07,360 --> 19:31:12,800
let me go ahead down here and I could

30849
19:31:09,720 --> 19:31:14,960
have multiple headings so H1 2 and down

30850
19:31:12,800 --> 19:31:18,360
here I could have another one H1

30851
19:31:14,960 --> 19:31:20,320
three and if I go back to my other tab I

30852
19:31:18,360 --> 19:31:23,552
reload it now we should see just like a

30853
19:31:20,320 --> 19:31:26,000
book or an essay now we have some

30854
19:31:23,552 --> 19:31:27,872
proper now we have some oops I have to

30855
19:31:26,000 --> 19:31:30,232
go to the right file sorry if I go back

30856
19:31:27,872 --> 19:31:32,680
to the index now we see the new third

30857
19:31:30,232 --> 19:31:35,192
file called headings. HTML and now we

30858
19:31:32,680 --> 19:31:37,120
indeed see some fairly pretty if simple

30859
19:31:35,192 --> 19:31:38,959
headings as well now if these aren't

30860
19:31:37,120 --> 19:31:40,680
three chapters 1 two three but maybe

30861
19:31:38,960 --> 19:31:42,280
it's a chapter then a section then a

30862
19:31:40,680 --> 19:31:44,799
subsection such that just visually you

30863
19:31:42,280 --> 19:31:46,400
want things to get smaller and smaller

30864
19:31:44,800 --> 19:31:49,080
well those exist too and in fact you can

30865
19:31:46,400 --> 19:31:51,192
do H1 through H6 H1 a little

30866
19:31:49,080 --> 19:31:54,160
paradoxically is the biggest and boldest

30867
19:31:51,192 --> 19:31:56,959
H6 is the smallest but still bold so it

30868
19:31:54,160 --> 19:31:59,400
might make sense to make this H2 both

30869
19:31:56,960 --> 19:32:01,720
open and close and maybe this H3 open

30870
19:31:59,400 --> 19:32:04,319
and close if again this is a section or

30871
19:32:01,720 --> 19:32:06,512
a subsection inside of that chapter if I

30872
19:32:04,320 --> 19:32:08,552
reload now notice just gets a little

30873
19:32:06,512 --> 19:32:11,160
smaller so it's more similar to what

30874
19:32:08,552 --> 19:32:13,319
you'd see on the printed page but this

30875
19:32:11,160 --> 19:32:15,800
now is just another three tags that I

30876
19:32:13,320 --> 19:32:17,720
might use in my own code all right well

30877
19:32:15,800 --> 19:32:19,640
how about lists of things I have three

30878
19:32:17,720 --> 19:32:21,960
paragraphs here but let's do this let me

30879
19:32:19,640 --> 19:32:23,872
go back to vs code I'm going to copy

30880
19:32:21,960 --> 19:32:26,320
this code so I have a starting point I'm

30881
19:32:23,872 --> 19:32:29,720
going to create a new file called say

30882
19:32:26,320 --> 19:32:31,640
list. HTML here I'm going to copy paste

30883
19:32:29,720 --> 19:32:33,552
I'm going to change my title to be list

30884
19:32:31,640 --> 19:32:34,760
just for clarity and in here I'm going

30885
19:32:33,552 --> 19:32:36,400
to go ahead and get rid of this whole

30886
19:32:34,760 --> 19:32:38,159
body because let's move away from these

30887
19:32:36,400 --> 19:32:40,360
massive paragraphs and keep it simpler

30888
19:32:38,160 --> 19:32:42,640
for now if I want to have a list of

30889
19:32:40,360 --> 19:32:44,360
things uh for instance uh if you haven't

30890
19:32:42,640 --> 19:32:45,400
seen these already a computer scientist

30891
19:32:44,360 --> 19:32:47,600
when they're fishing for just some

30892
19:32:45,400 --> 19:32:50,231
arbitrary meaningless words uh they

30893
19:32:47,600 --> 19:32:51,720
often use Foo bar and baz just as their

30894
19:32:50,232 --> 19:32:54,760
go-to just like a mathematician might

30895
19:32:51,720 --> 19:32:56,480
use XY Z for variables so Fu bar and baz

30896
19:32:54,760 --> 19:32:57,799
are on three separate lines and maybe

30897
19:32:56,480 --> 19:32:59,640
this is like my to-do list or my

30898
19:32:57,800 --> 19:33:02,400
shopping list but you can probably

30899
19:32:59,640 --> 19:33:04,720
imagine if I go back to my other tab go

30900
19:33:02,400 --> 19:33:05,799
back to the index I now see my new file

30901
19:33:04,720 --> 19:33:08,480
list.

30902
19:33:05,800 --> 19:33:10,160
HTML but it's probably going to look

30903
19:33:08,480 --> 19:33:13,159
wrong I think I'm just going to say yeah

30904
19:33:10,160 --> 19:33:15,360
Fubar baz all in one breath if you will

30905
19:33:13,160 --> 19:33:17,080
the not on new line and you can try to

30906
19:33:15,360 --> 19:33:19,552
fight this like you can be like really

30907
19:33:17,080 --> 19:33:21,680
want to put some line breaks there go

30908
19:33:19,552 --> 19:33:24,512
back and reload it's still not going to

30909
19:33:21,680 --> 19:33:25,920
make any change how do I want to fix

30910
19:33:24,512 --> 19:33:27,080
this well I can do this in a few ways I

30911
19:33:25,920 --> 19:33:29,319
could make them paragraphs but they're

30912
19:33:27,080 --> 19:33:31,552
not really paragraphs they're a list so

30913
19:33:29,320 --> 19:33:33,232
I'm going to use a different tag instead

30914
19:33:31,552 --> 19:33:36,760
I'm going to create for instance an

30915
19:33:33,232 --> 19:33:38,760
unordered list using the UL tag open and

30916
19:33:36,760 --> 19:33:41,120
close inside of that I'm going to use

30917
19:33:38,760 --> 19:33:43,439
the list item tag Li I and I'm going to

30918
19:33:41,120 --> 19:33:46,000
say Foo inside of another tag I'm going

30919
19:33:43,440 --> 19:33:48,000
to say bar inside of a third tag open

30920
19:33:46,000 --> 19:33:49,760
and close I'm going to say baz so it's

30921
19:33:48,000 --> 19:33:52,232
getting a little verbose but it's still

30922
19:33:49,760 --> 19:33:54,832
relatively succinct Li is all you need

30923
19:33:52,232 --> 19:33:57,360
type for list item UL is all you need

30924
19:33:54,832 --> 19:33:59,760
type for unordered list so there's some

30925
19:33:57,360 --> 19:34:01,320
shorthand syntax here that's adopted if

30926
19:33:59,760 --> 19:34:04,120
I now reload you're going to see a

30927
19:34:01,320 --> 19:34:05,872
so-called unordered list like not sorted

30928
19:34:04,120 --> 19:34:08,040
which means by convention to show it as

30929
19:34:05,872 --> 19:34:10,480
bullets though it could be displayed in

30930
19:34:08,040 --> 19:34:11,511
different ways visually as well if you

30931
19:34:10,480 --> 19:34:13,040
actually change your mind and you

30932
19:34:11,512 --> 19:34:14,640
realize oh I'd really like to number

30933
19:34:13,040 --> 19:34:17,871
this well you could obviously like just

30934
19:34:14,640 --> 19:34:19,120
add one and two and three but that's

30935
19:34:17,872 --> 19:34:20,720
going to get annoying especially if the

30936
19:34:19,120 --> 19:34:22,040
list grows you want to change something

30937
19:34:20,720 --> 19:34:24,680
insert something in the middle then you

30938
19:34:22,040 --> 19:34:26,832
have to reorder it I mean we using

30939
19:34:24,680 --> 19:34:29,719
computers here they can do this for us

30940
19:34:26,832 --> 19:34:33,120
so we can change the UL to any

30941
19:34:29,720 --> 19:34:34,800
guesses o maybe for ordered list which

30942
19:34:33,120 --> 19:34:37,280
is sort of the opposite here so let's

30943
19:34:34,800 --> 19:34:39,160
try changing that to O let me go back to

30944
19:34:37,280 --> 19:34:42,000
my browser and I'm just hitting command

30945
19:34:39,160 --> 19:34:44,192
r or controlr to reload the page instead

30946
19:34:42,000 --> 19:34:46,872
of clicking the button every time now I

30947
19:34:44,192 --> 19:34:48,720
automatically get 1 2 and three and you

30948
19:34:46,872 --> 19:34:50,320
can even override the Aesthetics using

30949
19:34:48,720 --> 19:34:52,480
different numera bles or symbology

30950
19:34:50,320 --> 19:34:55,440
instead but that would be perhaps the

30951
19:34:52,480 --> 19:34:58,319
most common there as well all right it's

30952
19:34:55,440 --> 19:35:02,000
a lot of tags quickly but any questions

30953
19:34:58,320 --> 19:35:03,680
on lists paragraphs headings or the like

30954
19:35:02,000 --> 19:35:07,160
no all right so let me go ahead and

30955
19:35:03,680 --> 19:35:09,599
propose this here um let's go ahead and

30956
19:35:07,160 --> 19:35:12,192
create what we'll call a table so let me

30957
19:35:09,600 --> 19:35:16,080
copy and paste this into a new file code

30958
19:35:12,192 --> 19:35:18,192
of table. HTML and in table. HTML let me

30959
19:35:16,080 --> 19:35:20,872
again rename the title to table let me

30960
19:35:18,192 --> 19:35:23,400
get rid of that ordered list from before

30961
19:35:20,872 --> 19:35:25,512
and let me now use a table tag open and

30962
19:35:23,400 --> 19:35:28,400
close this one's a little weird but

30963
19:35:25,512 --> 19:35:31,480
inside of a table you typically have a

30964
19:35:28,400 --> 19:35:33,192
head of the table so uh I'll say well

30965
19:35:31,480 --> 19:35:36,832
let's say the first row we'll keep this

30966
19:35:33,192 --> 19:35:39,599
one simple a table row or TR inside of a

30967
19:35:36,832 --> 19:35:41,192
table row you would ideally have columns

30968
19:35:39,600 --> 19:35:43,800
but that's not the nomenclature instead

30969
19:35:41,192 --> 19:35:45,231
you have data so TD for table data and

30970
19:35:43,800 --> 19:35:46,960
let me go ahead and just have the first

30971
19:35:45,232 --> 19:35:48,800
datm be one I'm just going to

30972
19:35:46,960 --> 19:35:50,480
arbitrarily do 1 two three just so we

30973
19:35:48,800 --> 19:35:52,920
have something to play with and you know

30974
19:35:50,480 --> 19:35:54,480
what just for demonstration sake I am

30975
19:35:52,920 --> 19:35:56,232
going to deliberately copy paste this

30976
19:35:54,480 --> 19:35:58,760
twice and I'm just going to manually

30977
19:35:56,232 --> 19:36:02,552
change the numbers just so we can see

30978
19:35:58,760 --> 19:36:04,319
what I'm creating 789 and then maybe

30979
19:36:02,552 --> 19:36:06,192
just for good measure if you're seeing

30980
19:36:04,320 --> 19:36:08,720
where this is going let me copy this one

30981
19:36:06,192 --> 19:36:11,871
more time and give myself a final row

30982
19:36:08,720 --> 19:36:13,800
with an asterisk a zero and a pound sign

30983
19:36:11,872 --> 19:36:16,192
if maybe you see where this is going let

30984
19:36:13,800 --> 19:36:18,680
me go back to my other tab let me go

30985
19:36:16,192 --> 19:36:21,400
back to the index there's my new file

30986
19:36:18,680 --> 19:36:24,280
table. HTML I'll click that and while

30987
19:36:21,400 --> 19:36:27,120
it's not very pretty I'll zoom in it's

30988
19:36:24,280 --> 19:36:29,720
indeed a table of data I happen to mimic

30989
19:36:27,120 --> 19:36:31,231
like a key uh a telephone keypad but you

30990
19:36:29,720 --> 19:36:32,640
could imagine this being much juicier

30991
19:36:31,232 --> 19:36:34,440
much more interesting scientific or

30992
19:36:32,640 --> 19:36:37,720
financial data or the like laid out into

30993
19:36:34,440 --> 19:36:39,872
these rows TRS and these columns AKA

30994
19:36:37,720 --> 19:36:42,400
table data as well so we have that

30995
19:36:39,872 --> 19:36:44,680
ability as well for structured data now

30996
19:36:42,400 --> 19:36:46,439
of course the internet um has lots of

30997
19:36:44,680 --> 19:36:49,000
images on it and in fact this is all

30998
19:36:46,440 --> 19:36:52,360
just text how can we introduce images

30999
19:36:49,000 --> 19:36:55,600
well let me go ahead and do this let me

31000
19:36:52,360 --> 19:36:57,920
first uh sort of semi secretly copy an

31001
19:36:55,600 --> 19:36:59,552
image file that I brought from uh

31002
19:36:57,920 --> 19:37:02,080
earlier just so we have something to

31003
19:36:59,552 --> 19:37:04,920
play with and I have in my account here

31004
19:37:02,080 --> 19:37:06,680
now an image called harbor. JPEG and I

31005
19:37:04,920 --> 19:37:08,319
uploaded this semi- secretly a second

31006
19:37:06,680 --> 19:37:10,920
ago into my account so that I can

31007
19:37:08,320 --> 19:37:13,120
reference a second file let me go ahead

31008
19:37:10,920 --> 19:37:14,440
and copy this HTML just to save myself

31009
19:37:13,120 --> 19:37:17,231
some keystrokes

31010
19:37:14,440 --> 19:37:19,920
let me go ahead and do code of image.

31011
19:37:17,232 --> 19:37:21,600
HTML and let me paste that code and hide

31012
19:37:19,920 --> 19:37:23,680
my terminal window I'm going to get rid

31013
19:37:21,600 --> 19:37:25,480
of all of this table as just

31014
19:37:23,680 --> 19:37:28,280
uninteresting now we're going to make

31015
19:37:25,480 --> 19:37:30,120
this even simpler by changing my title

31016
19:37:28,280 --> 19:37:33,040
to image to keep all these

31017
19:37:30,120 --> 19:37:35,080
demonstrations uh separate and now if I

31018
19:37:33,040 --> 19:37:37,439
want to make a web page that when

31019
19:37:35,080 --> 19:37:39,400
visited shows us a picture of Harvard

31020
19:37:37,440 --> 19:37:42,480
well there's an image tag abbreviated

31021
19:37:39,400 --> 19:37:45,231
IMG for short I can specify what the

31022
19:37:42,480 --> 19:37:47,552
source of that image is and if my file a

31023
19:37:45,232 --> 19:37:50,400
JPEG in this case is literally in the

31024
19:37:47,552 --> 19:37:52,480
same folder I can just say quote unquote

31025
19:37:50,400 --> 19:37:53,760
harvard. jpeg if it's in a folder I

31026
19:37:52,480 --> 19:37:55,872
should mention the folder name in a

31027
19:37:53,760 --> 19:37:57,599
slash or something like that if the

31028
19:37:55,872 --> 19:38:00,192
image is on the internet somewhere with

31029
19:37:57,600 --> 19:38:03,000
a URL I could also have a whole URL

31030
19:38:00,192 --> 19:38:05,760
https colon and then the URL of the

31031
19:38:03,000 --> 19:38:07,120
image but I upload it in in advance now

31032
19:38:05,760 --> 19:38:08,871
this is just going to visually display

31033
19:38:07,120 --> 19:38:10,959
on the screen but not everyone of course

31034
19:38:08,872 --> 19:38:12,960
can see images screen readers might need

31035
19:38:10,960 --> 19:38:14,832
a bit of assistance and even search

31036
19:38:12,960 --> 19:38:17,160
engines might want to analyze the page

31037
19:38:14,832 --> 19:38:18,599
and know what this is an image of now

31038
19:38:17,160 --> 19:38:20,192
machine learning and artificial

31039
19:38:18,600 --> 19:38:22,160
intelligence are maybe getting better to

31040
19:38:20,192 --> 19:38:23,720
be fair at figuring out just by

31041
19:38:22,160 --> 19:38:25,552
analyzing images what they are but

31042
19:38:23,720 --> 19:38:27,400
they're certainly imperfect I am a human

31043
19:38:25,552 --> 19:38:29,480
I know pretty well what I took a photo

31044
19:38:27,400 --> 19:38:31,159
of for instance so maybe what I should

31045
19:38:29,480 --> 19:38:33,640
do proactively which would be good for

31046
19:38:31,160 --> 19:38:35,920
accessibility is have this alt tag for

31047
19:38:33,640 --> 19:38:37,920
alternative text and then literally say

31048
19:38:35,920 --> 19:38:40,599
like Harvard University so that someone

31049
19:38:37,920 --> 19:38:42,280
who can't see or so that a a server can

31050
19:38:40,600 --> 19:38:43,960
actually know with higher probability

31051
19:38:42,280 --> 19:38:45,760
what it is uh they're looking at and I

31052
19:38:43,960 --> 19:38:48,080
could be even more detailed than just a

31053
19:38:45,760 --> 19:38:50,680
phrase I could describe the image as

31054
19:38:48,080 --> 19:38:53,920
well all right let me go back to my

31055
19:38:50,680 --> 19:38:56,400
index in the second tab let me go back

31056
19:38:53,920 --> 19:38:58,640
and zoom back out there's my new file

31057
19:38:56,400 --> 19:39:00,920
and there's my new JPEG that I quickly

31058
19:38:58,640 --> 19:39:03,960
uploaded before I can click now on

31059
19:39:00,920 --> 19:39:06,760
image. HTML and albeit a little

31060
19:39:03,960 --> 19:39:08,720
overwhelming that is a really big image

31061
19:39:06,760 --> 19:39:10,760
of harvor now apparently it's too big to

31062
19:39:08,720 --> 19:39:13,040
fit on the screen so this isn't the best

31063
19:39:10,760 --> 19:39:15,040
user experience to have to scroll up

31064
19:39:13,040 --> 19:39:17,400
okay so there's the image horrible

31065
19:39:15,040 --> 19:39:19,040
horrible design if you will at least in

31066
19:39:17,400 --> 19:39:21,000
terms of my code but there's going to be

31067
19:39:19,040 --> 19:39:23,000
ways where I can sort of rein that in

31068
19:39:21,000 --> 19:39:25,600
and affect the height or the width as

31069
19:39:23,000 --> 19:39:28,040
well but for now it's just deliberately

31070
19:39:25,600 --> 19:39:29,760
a little overwhelming instead now we can

31071
19:39:28,040 --> 19:39:32,192
do something a little more fun and

31072
19:39:29,760 --> 19:39:35,120
topical today uh which might be to use

31073
19:39:32,192 --> 19:39:37,680
an IM a video instead so let me go ahead

31074
19:39:35,120 --> 19:39:40,832
here and very quickly grab another file

31075
19:39:37,680 --> 19:39:42,231
today which is uh I brought in advance

31076
19:39:40,832 --> 19:39:45,439
and that you might have seen briefly

31077
19:39:42,232 --> 19:39:47,400
earlier which is an MP4 an actual video

31078
19:39:45,440 --> 19:39:49,480
file and what I'm going to do here by

31079
19:39:47,400 --> 19:39:51,920
revealing vs code again is I'm going to

31080
19:39:49,480 --> 19:39:53,959
code a file called video. HTML get

31081
19:39:51,920 --> 19:39:56,319
another demonstration here I'm going to

31082
19:39:53,960 --> 19:39:58,160
change my title to video just to keep

31083
19:39:56,320 --> 19:40:00,640
these things straight and instead of the

31084
19:39:58,160 --> 19:40:02,552
image tag you might imagine using now

31085
19:40:00,640 --> 19:40:05,120
indeed a video tag and this is a

31086
19:40:02,552 --> 19:40:06,760
relatively newer tag that has increasing

31087
19:40:05,120 --> 19:40:09,799
support among browsers so it's good now

31088
19:40:06,760 --> 19:40:12,192
to use and inside of this the syntax is

31089
19:40:09,800 --> 19:40:14,920
a little different you specify and this

31090
19:40:12,192 --> 19:40:18,159
is weirdly annoyingly in consistent not

31091
19:40:14,920 --> 19:40:20,480
SRC for Source you literally say source

31092
19:40:18,160 --> 19:40:23,280
and then in Source you use a source

31093
19:40:20,480 --> 19:40:25,040
attribute horrible design semantically

31094
19:40:23,280 --> 19:40:27,680
but like this is what we're stuck with

31095
19:40:25,040 --> 19:40:29,360
halloween. MP4 is the name of the video

31096
19:40:27,680 --> 19:40:31,640
we uploaded in advance made by some of

31097
19:40:29,360 --> 19:40:33,160
harder Harvard's digital artists and the

31098
19:40:31,640 --> 19:40:36,319
type of this video so that the browser

31099
19:40:33,160 --> 19:40:38,000
knows for sure is video/ MP4 that's a

31100
19:40:36,320 --> 19:40:40,360
so-called content type that you just

31101
19:40:38,000 --> 19:40:42,760
know or you look up to figure it out and

31102
19:40:40,360 --> 19:40:45,320
just so that this is as animated as

31103
19:40:42,760 --> 19:40:48,120
possible I'm going to tell the video tag

31104
19:40:45,320 --> 19:40:50,960
with a few attributes to autoplay and it

31105
19:40:48,120 --> 19:40:53,599
turns out that attributes often have key

31106
19:40:50,960 --> 19:40:56,160
value pairs whereby it's the key the

31107
19:40:53,600 --> 19:40:57,872
attribute name equals quote unquote some

31108
19:40:56,160 --> 19:41:00,120
value just like Lang equals quote

31109
19:40:57,872 --> 19:41:02,040
unquote for English but not all

31110
19:41:00,120 --> 19:41:04,231
attributes need values in fact if you

31111
19:41:02,040 --> 19:41:06,231
read the documentation for html's video

31112
19:41:04,232 --> 19:41:07,872
tag there's an autoplay attribute where

31113
19:41:06,232 --> 19:41:09,280
you can literally just say the key and

31114
19:41:07,872 --> 19:41:10,960
it needs no value it's just going to

31115
19:41:09,280 --> 19:41:13,360
mean autoplay and if you don't want to

31116
19:41:10,960 --> 19:41:15,120
autoplay you just omit it alt together

31117
19:41:13,360 --> 19:41:17,512
so so you don't necessarily need a value

31118
19:41:15,120 --> 19:41:19,159
on or off uh I want the thing to Loop

31119
19:41:17,512 --> 19:41:21,320
just so it keeps going I want it to be

31120
19:41:19,160 --> 19:41:23,120
muted so that we don't hear any sound in

31121
19:41:21,320 --> 19:41:25,832
fact there is no sound but browsers

31122
19:41:23,120 --> 19:41:28,799
nowadays for anti-spam and advertising

31123
19:41:25,832 --> 19:41:30,280
reasons often will not play a video if

31124
19:41:28,800 --> 19:41:31,960
it has sound because it's just kind of

31125
19:41:30,280 --> 19:41:34,000
obnoxious if you visit a page and all of

31126
19:41:31,960 --> 19:41:35,480
a sudden your speakers start blaring so

31127
19:41:34,000 --> 19:41:37,160
I know this from having read up on this

31128
19:41:35,480 --> 19:41:39,159
that I should mute it so if I want it to

31129
19:41:37,160 --> 19:41:41,640
actually autoplay for real and then I'll

31130
19:41:39,160 --> 19:41:44,280
set the width manually for now to be

31131
19:41:41,640 --> 19:41:46,440
like 128 pixels across just from some

31132
19:41:44,280 --> 19:41:49,680
trial and error earlier and that with

31133
19:41:46,440 --> 19:41:52,400
attribute does have a value now I'm

31134
19:41:49,680 --> 19:41:54,640
being a little um a little uptight here

31135
19:41:52,400 --> 19:41:56,360
by alphabetizing all of my attributes

31136
19:41:54,640 --> 19:41:57,800
not at all necessary I do it just so I

31137
19:41:56,360 --> 19:41:59,512
can skim things faster and know if

31138
19:41:57,800 --> 19:42:01,872
something is there or not so for me it's

31139
19:41:59,512 --> 19:42:04,400
just a matter of style let me go back to

31140
19:42:01,872 --> 19:42:07,280
my other tab go back to my index and

31141
19:42:04,400 --> 19:42:10,599
you'll see two new files again the mp4

31142
19:42:07,280 --> 19:42:13,000
file and video. HTML I'll click on the

31143
19:42:10,600 --> 19:42:15,320
ladder and if I did this well here we

31144
19:42:13,000 --> 19:42:17,960
have thank thanks to our friends in

31145
19:42:15,320 --> 19:42:20,640
Harvard U our artistic friends at

31146
19:42:17,960 --> 19:42:22,320
Harvard very like an oo would help with

31147
19:42:20,640 --> 19:42:24,512
the drama here but okay but we have a

31148
19:42:22,320 --> 19:42:26,872
very dramatic nice Halloween type view

31149
19:42:24,512 --> 19:42:28,320
here as well so we have videos embedded

31150
19:42:26,872 --> 19:42:30,680
as well and suffice it to say there's

31151
19:42:28,320 --> 19:42:33,400
ways to embed YouTube videos or Vimeo or

31152
19:42:30,680 --> 19:42:35,719
other services as well using yet more

31153
19:42:33,400 --> 19:42:38,511
tags too but the web is of course all

31154
19:42:35,720 --> 19:42:39,872
about hyperlink Hyper text markup

31155
19:42:38,512 --> 19:42:41,120
language where you click on something

31156
19:42:39,872 --> 19:42:42,872
and you end up somewhere else and this

31157
19:42:41,120 --> 19:42:44,000
is how the web is so powerfully

31158
19:42:42,872 --> 19:42:45,920
interconnected

31159
19:42:44,000 --> 19:42:48,640
so how do we start creating links from

31160
19:42:45,920 --> 19:42:50,832
one website or web page to another

31161
19:42:48,640 --> 19:42:53,040
either that I made or someone else well

31162
19:42:50,832 --> 19:42:54,959
let me go ahead and open back up my

31163
19:42:53,040 --> 19:42:57,439
terminal window and let's create a file

31164
19:42:54,960 --> 19:42:59,600
called link. HTML just to demonstrate

31165
19:42:57,440 --> 19:43:01,512
what you and I know as a link I'll hide

31166
19:42:59,600 --> 19:43:03,512
my terminal window now let me copy paste

31167
19:43:01,512 --> 19:43:05,232
just to save myself some keystrokes and

31168
19:43:03,512 --> 19:43:08,192
let me get rid of the video tag so we

31169
19:43:05,232 --> 19:43:10,872
can focus now on links suppose that I

31170
19:43:08,192 --> 19:43:13,480
want you to visit Harvard virtually well

31171
19:43:10,872 --> 19:43:16,080
I could say something like visit uh

31172
19:43:13,480 --> 19:43:17,512
Harvard period this is uninteresting

31173
19:43:16,080 --> 19:43:19,480
because it's just going to be text I

31174
19:43:17,512 --> 19:43:21,832
probably want you to actually visit

31175
19:43:19,480 --> 19:43:23,080
harvard.edu instead more specifically

31176
19:43:21,832 --> 19:43:25,080
and I'll lower case it just to be

31177
19:43:23,080 --> 19:43:27,120
consistent with what browsers do in the

31178
19:43:25,080 --> 19:43:29,080
address bar all right let me go now to

31179
19:43:27,120 --> 19:43:32,080
the video uh back to this video Tab and

31180
19:43:29,080 --> 19:43:34,600
go back where we now see my index I'll

31181
19:43:32,080 --> 19:43:36,360
Zoom back in and there's link. HTML

31182
19:43:34,600 --> 19:43:38,400
unfortunately when I click this and I'll

31183
19:43:36,360 --> 19:43:40,232
zoom in you literally just see the text

31184
19:43:38,400 --> 19:43:42,159
that I wrote and yet on every social

31185
19:43:40,232 --> 19:43:44,320
media platform nowadays except like

31186
19:43:42,160 --> 19:43:45,920
Instagram when you type a URL or what

31187
19:43:44,320 --> 19:43:49,440
looks like a URL even if you didn't

31188
19:43:45,920 --> 19:43:51,319
bother with the HTTP or https it usually

31189
19:43:49,440 --> 19:43:53,080
automatically links it for you on

31190
19:43:51,320 --> 19:43:55,872
Facebook on Twitter and other sites as

31191
19:43:53,080 --> 19:43:57,960
well that's just a convenience Discord

31192
19:43:55,872 --> 19:43:59,320
and slack do that too but they're just

31193
19:43:57,960 --> 19:44:02,440
doing it to make things more

31194
19:43:59,320 --> 19:44:06,120
userfriendly but they have to generate

31195
19:44:02,440 --> 19:44:08,120
HTML with the proper tags and attributes

31196
19:44:06,120 --> 19:44:09,760
so to get this to actually work it's not

31197
19:44:08,120 --> 19:44:13,080
even good enough to say

31198
19:44:09,760 --> 19:44:15,192
https www.harvard.edu because if I go

31199
19:44:13,080 --> 19:44:17,552
back now and reload now you'll literally

31200
19:44:15,192 --> 19:44:19,920
just see all of that as text if you want

31201
19:44:17,552 --> 19:44:22,760
the browser to treat this as a link you

31202
19:44:19,920 --> 19:44:24,192
need to use the anchor tag it'd be great

31203
19:44:22,760 --> 19:44:26,680
if it were called the link tag but it's

31204
19:44:24,192 --> 19:44:29,319
not it's called The Anchor tag or a for

31205
19:44:26,680 --> 19:44:31,832
short and the way you reference the URL

31206
19:44:29,320 --> 19:44:34,512
to which you want to lead the user is

31207
19:44:31,832 --> 19:44:36,120
via href for hyper reference this is one

31208
19:44:34,512 --> 19:44:38,920
of the earliest tags perhaps among the

31209
19:44:36,120 --> 19:44:42,512
most Arcane now but if I then put that

31210
19:44:38,920 --> 19:44:44,552
whole URL in quotes and close my tag I

31211
19:44:42,512 --> 19:44:46,360
now have to opportunity to finish my

31212
19:44:44,552 --> 19:44:49,512
thought in between the start tag and the

31213
19:44:46,360 --> 19:44:51,680
end tag for this anchor and what I put

31214
19:44:49,512 --> 19:44:53,800
in between the start and end tag is

31215
19:44:51,680 --> 19:44:56,511
whatever the human's going to see so

31216
19:44:53,800 --> 19:44:59,640
here I can say Harvard I can go back to

31217
19:44:56,512 --> 19:45:02,360
my other tab I can reload the page and

31218
19:44:59,640 --> 19:45:04,480
now you see the familiar blue underline

31219
19:45:02,360 --> 19:45:05,960
this now is an actual link and if I

31220
19:45:04,480 --> 19:45:09,599
click it I'll be whisked away to the

31221
19:45:05,960 --> 19:45:12,360
actual Harvard websites but there's a

31222
19:45:09,600 --> 19:45:15,192
risk here can anyone imagine pretty

31223
19:45:12,360 --> 19:45:17,160
simply after like what 60 seconds of the

31224
19:45:15,192 --> 19:45:20,440
link tag of the anchor tag how could

31225
19:45:17,160 --> 19:45:23,360
someone an adversary misuse this tag

31226
19:45:20,440 --> 19:45:25,640
alone How could a website run by an

31227
19:45:23,360 --> 19:45:29,920
adversary How could a spammer misuse

31228
19:45:25,640 --> 19:45:29,920
this tag do you think

31229
19:45:31,160 --> 19:45:35,872
yeah yeah absolutely you could have it

31230
19:45:33,552 --> 19:45:38,400
say one thing but lead another lead

31231
19:45:35,872 --> 19:45:40,480
elsewhere so I could say Yale in here

31232
19:45:38,400 --> 19:45:42,159
nothing stopping me as the developer go

31233
19:45:40,480 --> 19:45:44,599
back to the page reload now it says

31234
19:45:42,160 --> 19:45:46,120
visit Yale you click on Yale and voila

31235
19:45:44,600 --> 19:45:48,800
you end up applying to the wrong place

31236
19:45:46,120 --> 19:45:51,319
instead now there's some hints of this I

31237
19:45:48,800 --> 19:45:53,120
could hover over this and super small

31238
19:45:51,320 --> 19:45:55,680
like this isn't very good for your

31239
19:45:53,120 --> 19:45:57,480
anti-hacking techniques but way down

31240
19:45:55,680 --> 19:45:59,319
here you can actually see the URL that

31241
19:45:57,480 --> 19:46:01,080
it's going to go to in most browsers

31242
19:45:59,320 --> 19:46:03,192
indeed do this at least on desktops and

31243
19:46:01,080 --> 19:46:04,360
laptops so it's a little bit of a hint

31244
19:46:03,192 --> 19:46:07,231
but what you're seeing here even though

31245
19:46:04,360 --> 19:46:09,872
this is kind of a silly um uh playful

31246
19:46:07,232 --> 19:46:13,872
example this is exactly how fishing

31247
19:46:09,872 --> 19:46:15,760
attacks work p i sh iing work whereby an

31248
19:46:13,872 --> 19:46:17,512
adversary tells you to log into your

31249
19:46:15,760 --> 19:46:20,280
PayPal account but it doesn't go to

31250
19:46:17,512 --> 19:46:22,480
paypal.com it goes to some other random

31251
19:46:20,280 --> 19:46:24,000
website that they bought and built that

31252
19:46:22,480 --> 19:46:25,552
then tries to collect your username and

31253
19:46:24,000 --> 19:46:27,440
password and stored in their database so

31254
19:46:25,552 --> 19:46:30,440
now they can log into your PayPal

31255
19:46:27,440 --> 19:46:32,400
account as you and it boils down to that

31256
19:46:30,440 --> 19:46:35,280
simple primitive and you can be even

31257
19:46:32,400 --> 19:46:38,400
more manipulative to you can even say

31258
19:46:35,280 --> 19:46:43,480
the whole URL for Yale like yale.edu or

31259
19:46:38,400 --> 19:46:45,832
Worse htps www.yale.edu reload that and

31260
19:46:43,480 --> 19:46:47,480
now who I mean who among you and people

31261
19:46:45,832 --> 19:46:49,760
in your lives are necessarily going to

31262
19:46:47,480 --> 19:46:52,080
be so paranoid as to not just blindly

31263
19:46:49,760 --> 19:46:54,552
click on that URL this is why just being

31264
19:46:52,080 --> 19:46:57,000
a defensive real world person nowadays

31265
19:46:54,552 --> 19:46:58,440
digitally is just ever more so important

31266
19:46:57,000 --> 19:47:01,192
so these same things that can be used

31267
19:46:58,440 --> 19:47:03,960
for good or uh benign use cases can also

31268
19:47:01,192 --> 19:47:07,799
be used for ill purposes too and it is

31269
19:47:03,960 --> 19:47:09,800
literally that simple questions now on

31270
19:47:07,800 --> 19:47:13,760
any of these tags thus

31271
19:47:09,800 --> 19:47:15,800
far just a few more to offer up any

31272
19:47:13,760 --> 19:47:18,959
questions on this

31273
19:47:15,800 --> 19:47:20,360
here no well let me open up a couple

31274
19:47:18,960 --> 19:47:23,080
that I brought in advance just so we

31275
19:47:20,360 --> 19:47:24,920
don't have to type all of them here um

31276
19:47:23,080 --> 19:47:27,000
if you for instance have a web page

31277
19:47:24,920 --> 19:47:29,800
that's got quite a bit of code let me go

31278
19:47:27,000 --> 19:47:33,000
ahead and grab from the website a couple

31279
19:47:29,800 --> 19:47:37,512
of examples real fast here namely one

31280
19:47:33,000 --> 19:47:40,400
that we'll call how about uh meta

31281
19:47:37,512 --> 19:47:42,720
HTML and in this example here give me

31282
19:47:40,400 --> 19:47:43,511
just a moment to full screen it we're

31283
19:47:42,720 --> 19:47:48,480
going to

31284
19:47:43,512 --> 19:47:50,512
have a file So codem Meta HTML I'll open

31285
19:47:48,480 --> 19:47:53,192
this up next no relationship to what we

31286
19:47:50,512 --> 19:47:55,120
now know as meta the company but rather

31287
19:47:53,192 --> 19:47:56,920
this is going to be a page that I copied

31288
19:47:55,120 --> 19:47:58,360
and pasted the same chunk of Latin like

31289
19:47:56,920 --> 19:48:00,400
text from earlier so it's going to be a

31290
19:47:58,360 --> 19:48:01,760
really big paragraph of text and this is

31291
19:48:00,400 --> 19:48:03,400
an example where if you were to open

31292
19:48:01,760 --> 19:48:05,480
this web page not on my own Mac or your

31293
19:48:03,400 --> 19:48:07,280
PC but on your phone the font might

31294
19:48:05,480 --> 19:48:08,440
actually be really annoying and

31295
19:48:07,280 --> 19:48:10,040
difficult to read why because your

31296
19:48:08,440 --> 19:48:12,400
phone's going to try to squeeze all of

31297
19:48:10,040 --> 19:48:14,640
the content onto the tiny viewport the

31298
19:48:12,400 --> 19:48:16,832
rectangular region of your phone instead

31299
19:48:14,640 --> 19:48:19,192
so it turns out there are ways pretty

31300
19:48:16,832 --> 19:48:20,799
easy ways to make your website mobile

31301
19:48:19,192 --> 19:48:22,720
friendly as well Otherwise Known

31302
19:48:20,800 --> 19:48:26,040
technically as responsive and the

31303
19:48:22,720 --> 19:48:29,120
easiest way to do this is to include

31304
19:48:26,040 --> 19:48:30,640
this tag here a meta tag again no

31305
19:48:29,120 --> 19:48:32,920
relationship to Facebook this has been

31306
19:48:30,640 --> 19:48:36,280
here much longer and this case here this

31307
19:48:32,920 --> 19:48:38,080
meta tag online five has its own sort of

31308
19:48:36,280 --> 19:48:39,720
approach to key value pairs this is a

31309
19:48:38,080 --> 19:48:41,400
good example of where it'd be nice if it

31310
19:48:39,720 --> 19:48:43,512
looked just like everything else but

31311
19:48:41,400 --> 19:48:45,079
this is what we have historically

31312
19:48:43,512 --> 19:48:47,160
you can have a meta tag with an

31313
19:48:45,080 --> 19:48:49,040
attribute called name that refers to the

31314
19:48:47,160 --> 19:48:51,120
name of some feature of the browser in

31315
19:48:49,040 --> 19:48:53,040
this case viewport is the technical term

31316
19:48:51,120 --> 19:48:54,871
for like the big rectangular region to

31317
19:48:53,040 --> 19:48:57,439
which I keep referring the body really

31318
19:48:54,872 --> 19:48:59,872
of your page the content for the

31319
19:48:57,440 --> 19:49:01,640
viewport you can say some AR esoteric

31320
19:48:59,872 --> 19:49:03,440
details like this the initial scale

31321
19:49:01,640 --> 19:49:05,080
should be one that is no matter who

31322
19:49:03,440 --> 19:49:07,120
visits your site it shouldn't start

31323
19:49:05,080 --> 19:49:08,680
zoomed in it shouldn't start zoomed out

31324
19:49:07,120 --> 19:49:11,231
it should start at just the default

31325
19:49:08,680 --> 19:49:13,192
sizing and then this here with equals

31326
19:49:11,232 --> 19:49:15,720
device width is a very arcane way of

31327
19:49:13,192 --> 19:49:18,480
saying if the user has a small screen

31328
19:49:15,720 --> 19:49:20,440
show the text proportional to that size

31329
19:49:18,480 --> 19:49:22,800
don't just try to cram it all into a

31330
19:49:20,440 --> 19:49:24,552
tiny little window so it's super simple

31331
19:49:22,800 --> 19:49:26,552
but if for the next problem set or

31332
19:49:24,552 --> 19:49:28,319
future projects as well you find that

31333
19:49:26,552 --> 19:49:31,000
just things look really bad on mobile

31334
19:49:28,320 --> 19:49:33,400
like this kind of tag is the place to

31335
19:49:31,000 --> 19:49:35,192
start meta there aren't terribly many of

31336
19:49:33,400 --> 19:49:37,760
these that you'll use but they're useful

31337
19:49:35,192 --> 19:49:39,871
for other mechanisms as well in fact let

31338
19:49:37,760 --> 19:49:43,040
me go ahead and semi secretly pull up

31339
19:49:39,872 --> 19:49:45,512
one other example as well whereby I'm

31340
19:49:43,040 --> 19:49:49,231
going to grab another example that uses

31341
19:49:45,512 --> 19:49:51,640
more of these tags and in just a moment

31342
19:49:49,232 --> 19:49:56,080
I'll reveal it here give me just one

31343
19:49:51,640 --> 19:49:57,232
second here I'll have I'll propose that

31344
19:49:56,080 --> 19:49:58,960
in this

31345
19:49:57,232 --> 19:50:03,872
example of

31346
19:49:58,960 --> 19:50:05,600
meta we now add these properties instead

31347
19:50:03,872 --> 19:50:07,320
so I copy pasted this from an existing

31348
19:50:05,600 --> 19:50:09,192
file just so as to not waste time typing

31349
19:50:07,320 --> 19:50:12,280
all of these out if you've ever shared a

31350
19:50:09,192 --> 19:50:14,192
URL on Facebook or Twitter or slack or

31351
19:50:12,280 --> 19:50:15,872
Discord order any number of websites

31352
19:50:14,192 --> 19:50:17,552
nowadays that automatically show a nice

31353
19:50:15,872 --> 19:50:19,160
preview where you sudden instantly see

31354
19:50:17,552 --> 19:50:21,480
like the default image of the page maybe

31355
19:50:19,160 --> 19:50:24,080
a few sentences or words of text or

31356
19:50:21,480 --> 19:50:25,640
something like that sometimes those

31357
19:50:24,080 --> 19:50:27,512
applications those websites will just

31358
19:50:25,640 --> 19:50:29,232
choose like the first image it finds on

31359
19:50:27,512 --> 19:50:31,232
the website or the first sentence it

31360
19:50:29,232 --> 19:50:33,440
sees and show that but that might not be

31361
19:50:31,232 --> 19:50:35,832
very user friendly or search engine

31362
19:50:33,440 --> 19:50:38,480
friendly and so a prog a developer might

31363
19:50:35,832 --> 19:50:40,231
want to control what it is that slack

31364
19:50:38,480 --> 19:50:43,120
Discord Facebook Twitter and other such

31365
19:50:40,232 --> 19:50:45,600
sites show by default for that can use

31366
19:50:43,120 --> 19:50:47,799
nowadays what are called open graph tags

31367
19:50:45,600 --> 19:50:49,552
which is to say there's other uses of

31368
19:50:47,800 --> 19:50:50,920
the meta tag and you just look these

31369
19:50:49,552 --> 19:50:52,760
things up even I had to look this up to

31370
19:50:50,920 --> 19:50:54,680
remember what the key value pairs are

31371
19:50:52,760 --> 19:50:56,552
the meta tag can also have a property

31372
19:50:54,680 --> 19:50:59,480
attribute that can be these very

31373
19:50:56,552 --> 19:51:02,080
specific strings OG title OG description

31374
19:50:59,480 --> 19:51:03,872
OG image which denotes open graph which

31375
19:51:02,080 --> 19:51:06,320
again is this standard that's evolved in

31376
19:51:03,872 --> 19:51:09,480
recent years and what you can do here is

31377
19:51:06,320 --> 19:51:11,872
tell browsers and in turn servers what

31378
19:51:09,480 --> 19:51:13,512
you want them to show as the default

31379
19:51:11,872 --> 19:51:15,320
title of the page P the description of

31380
19:51:13,512 --> 19:51:17,192
the page and even the default image just

31381
19:51:15,320 --> 19:51:20,280
so you can exercise more control when

31382
19:51:17,192 --> 19:51:21,720
sharing things socially nowadays as well

31383
19:51:20,280 --> 19:51:23,400
again it just boils down to these key

31384
19:51:21,720 --> 19:51:25,192
value pairs this is absolutely the kind

31385
19:51:23,400 --> 19:51:26,959
of thing you look up as needed to cross

31386
19:51:25,192 --> 19:51:28,400
check but those capabilities are there

31387
19:51:26,960 --> 19:51:30,232
and so literally the next time you paste

31388
19:51:28,400 --> 19:51:32,799
a link into slack or Discord or any

31389
19:51:30,232 --> 19:51:35,360
online site that then displays it in

31390
19:51:32,800 --> 19:51:37,440
embedded fashion just know that all this

31391
19:51:35,360 --> 19:51:40,720
time a little bit of textual code like

31392
19:51:37,440 --> 19:51:43,120
this in HTML has been there by whoever

31393
19:51:40,720 --> 19:51:45,232
authored the site

31394
19:51:43,120 --> 19:51:48,040
all right let's do one final example in

31395
19:51:45,232 --> 19:51:49,872
HTML alone before we transition to just

31396
19:51:48,040 --> 19:51:51,480
cleaning up the Aesthetics and improving

31397
19:51:49,872 --> 19:51:53,760
the visuals of everything we've been

31398
19:51:51,480 --> 19:51:56,640
creating let me go ahead here and close

31399
19:51:53,760 --> 19:52:00,040
meta HTML let me code up a new file

31400
19:51:56,640 --> 19:52:02,480
called how about search. HTML and see if

31401
19:52:00,040 --> 19:52:04,552
we can't draw some inspiration from our

31402
19:52:02,480 --> 19:52:07,120
cursory understanding earlier of how

31403
19:52:04,552 --> 19:52:09,480
URLs work to see if we can't reinvent

31404
19:52:07,120 --> 19:52:11,871
google.com itself so recall that a

31405
19:52:09,480 --> 19:52:13,920
canonical URL might look like this here

31406
19:52:11,872 --> 19:52:17,400
and in particular if you want to pass in

31407
19:52:13,920 --> 19:52:19,360
user input to that URL again you can

31408
19:52:17,400 --> 19:52:21,552
potentially have a question mark and

31409
19:52:19,360 --> 19:52:23,280
then a key equals value pair or for that

31410
19:52:21,552 --> 19:52:25,120
matter you can even have multiple key

31411
19:52:23,280 --> 19:52:26,640
value pairs that by convention are

31412
19:52:25,120 --> 19:52:28,120
separated by ampers sense these things

31413
19:52:26,640 --> 19:52:29,872
are everywhere like later today when you

31414
19:52:28,120 --> 19:52:32,280
pull up almost any website in your

31415
19:52:29,872 --> 19:52:34,320
browser look at the URL and you'll just

31416
19:52:32,280 --> 19:52:35,512
see a lot of this a lot of noise too and

31417
19:52:34,320 --> 19:52:38,040
distractions but there's going to be

31418
19:52:35,512 --> 19:52:39,640
some equal signs most likely Andor some

31419
19:52:38,040 --> 19:52:42,192
ampersands as well and those are just

31420
19:52:39,640 --> 19:52:44,680
separating key value pairs now what can

31421
19:52:42,192 --> 19:52:47,599
I do here well if you think back to how

31422
19:52:44,680 --> 19:52:49,192
we manually searched for cats earlier

31423
19:52:47,600 --> 19:52:52,480
let me quickly do this I'll do this one

31424
19:52:49,192 --> 19:52:55,720
manually doc type HTML as my very first

31425
19:52:52,480 --> 19:52:58,512
line HTML tag with how about my Lang

31426
19:52:55,720 --> 19:53:00,320
attribute for English up here and then

31427
19:52:58,512 --> 19:53:02,160
inside of this I'll have a head tag

31428
19:53:00,320 --> 19:53:05,440
inside of this I'll have a title I'll

31429
19:53:02,160 --> 19:53:07,160
call this example uh search and then

31430
19:53:05,440 --> 19:53:09,360
down here I'll have my beginning of a

31431
19:53:07,160 --> 19:53:12,512
body tag and now let me introduce you to

31432
19:53:09,360 --> 19:53:14,400
really a final tag for now uh a form tag

31433
19:53:12,512 --> 19:53:16,080
which will create a web form the thing

31434
19:53:14,400 --> 19:53:17,920
with text boxes and buttons that you and

31435
19:53:16,080 --> 19:53:20,080
I use every day on any number of

31436
19:53:17,920 --> 19:53:22,720
websites inside of this form I'm going

31437
19:53:20,080 --> 19:53:25,280
to have an input like a text box whose

31438
19:53:22,720 --> 19:53:27,552
name is going to be Q for query because

31439
19:53:25,280 --> 19:53:31,120
I'm trying to re-implement Google here

31440
19:53:27,552 --> 19:53:33,599
uh the uh type of that I want to be a

31441
19:53:31,120 --> 19:53:35,400
text box or if I know I'm using this for

31442
19:53:33,600 --> 19:53:37,192
search I can actually change this to a

31443
19:53:35,400 --> 19:53:38,640
search box and it's going to let me it's

31444
19:53:37,192 --> 19:53:40,280
going to generally put a little X there

31445
19:53:38,640 --> 19:53:42,680
so you can clear it quickly that's a

31446
19:53:40,280 --> 19:53:44,440
nice little enhancement as well and then

31447
19:53:42,680 --> 19:53:47,359
I'm going to give myself a submit button

31448
19:53:44,440 --> 19:53:49,480
by doing input whoops I'm going to give

31449
19:53:47,360 --> 19:53:53,360
myself a submit button by doing input

31450
19:53:49,480 --> 19:53:55,640
type equals submit and then I'll leave

31451
19:53:53,360 --> 19:53:57,232
that as such here all right now I need

31452
19:53:55,640 --> 19:53:58,800
to do a little bit more but let's see

31453
19:53:57,232 --> 19:54:01,800
how this looks let me go over to my

31454
19:53:58,800 --> 19:54:03,040
other tab let me go back to my index and

31455
19:54:01,800 --> 19:54:07,080
if I zoom

31456
19:54:03,040 --> 19:54:08,552
out there is search. HTML I'll click it

31457
19:54:07,080 --> 19:54:10,640
and there's not much going on here even

31458
19:54:08,552 --> 19:54:13,599
if I zoom in but I do indeed have a

31459
19:54:10,640 --> 19:54:16,232
really big text box and a submit button

31460
19:54:13,600 --> 19:54:18,360
but I haven't in my HTML told anyone

31461
19:54:16,232 --> 19:54:20,960
anywhere that I want this input whether

31462
19:54:18,360 --> 19:54:22,080
I type cat or dog to go to google.com so

31463
19:54:20,960 --> 19:54:23,320
for that I need a couple of more

31464
19:54:22,080 --> 19:54:24,552
attributes and I know this from having

31465
19:54:23,320 --> 19:54:26,832
done this before and any online

31466
19:54:24,552 --> 19:54:28,480
reference will say the same you can add

31467
19:54:26,832 --> 19:54:30,439
an action attribute like what do you

31468
19:54:28,480 --> 19:54:32,959
want the action of this form to be and

31469
19:54:30,440 --> 19:54:34,480
you can put the URL to which you want

31470
19:54:32,960 --> 19:54:38,800
this form to be submitted and I know

31471
19:54:34,480 --> 19:54:41,120
from tinkering that it should be hdps

31472
19:54:38,800 --> 19:54:43,552
www.google.com search I don't need to

31473
19:54:41,120 --> 19:54:47,231
put any question marks here myself but I

31474
19:54:43,552 --> 19:54:49,920
do want the uh browser to do that for me

31475
19:54:47,232 --> 19:54:52,680
so let me go back to my other tab let me

31476
19:54:49,920 --> 19:54:55,800
reload and nothing visually has happened

31477
19:54:52,680 --> 19:54:57,832
but watch this when I now type in cats

31478
19:54:55,800 --> 19:55:01,440
but before I hit enter notice that I'm

31479
19:54:57,832 --> 19:55:04,680
currently at some long crazy URL search.

31480
19:55:01,440 --> 19:55:06,360
HTML is expected if I now go down to the

31481
19:55:04,680 --> 19:55:08,400
submit button and click submit watch

31482
19:55:06,360 --> 19:55:11,440
what happens to the URL and the page

31483
19:55:08,400 --> 19:55:13,120
itself I'm whisked away to the actual

31484
19:55:11,440 --> 19:55:15,360
google.com and indeed there are those

31485
19:55:13,120 --> 19:55:17,680
same cats and if I zoom in here you'll

31486
19:55:15,360 --> 19:55:20,440
see that my URL has changed to be indeed

31487
19:55:17,680 --> 19:55:22,040
SL search question mark Q equals cats so

31488
19:55:20,440 --> 19:55:24,480
this is just how web forms work when you

31489
19:55:22,040 --> 19:55:26,552
submit any form on the web in this way

31490
19:55:24,480 --> 19:55:29,159
the browser automatically goes to that

31491
19:55:26,552 --> 19:55:31,000
action URL adds a question mark puts any

31492
19:55:29,160 --> 19:55:33,120
key value pairs that you manually typed

31493
19:55:31,000 --> 19:55:35,080
into the text boxes and lets the server

31494
19:55:33,120 --> 19:55:37,040
do its thing now here's where Chrome is

31495
19:55:35,080 --> 19:55:39,440
starting to simplify things Safari does

31496
19:55:37,040 --> 19:55:41,599
this too if you double click on your url

31497
19:55:39,440 --> 19:55:43,512
now you see the full URL but if any

31498
19:55:41,600 --> 19:55:45,720
parts are missing that's just a UI thing

31499
19:55:43,512 --> 19:55:48,160
to eliminate visual distractions

31500
19:55:45,720 --> 19:55:50,872
nowadays meanwhile if I go back to my

31501
19:55:48,160 --> 19:55:53,640
own form if I search this time for dogs

31502
19:55:50,872 --> 19:55:57,720
and hit enter now again the URL changes

31503
19:55:53,640 --> 19:56:00,360
to be Q equals dogs and it all reduces

31504
19:55:57,720 --> 19:56:02,960
to this basic building block of using an

31505
19:56:00,360 --> 19:56:05,080
a form tag now I can be more explicit if

31506
19:56:02,960 --> 19:56:06,720
I know I want to use get it which is

31507
19:56:05,080 --> 19:56:08,720
actually the default I can literally say

31508
19:56:06,720 --> 19:56:10,552
quote unquote get in all lowercase even

31509
19:56:08,720 --> 19:56:12,360
though the verb earlier was by Design in

31510
19:56:10,552 --> 19:56:14,760
uppercase but here now I'm just being

31511
19:56:12,360 --> 19:56:17,160
ever more explicit if I don't want the

31512
19:56:14,760 --> 19:56:19,231
label of this button to be very

31513
19:56:17,160 --> 19:56:21,480
generically submit maybe I want it to be

31514
19:56:19,232 --> 19:56:23,800
Google search quote unquote well if you

31515
19:56:21,480 --> 19:56:25,720
read the documentation for forms you can

31516
19:56:23,800 --> 19:56:28,400
actually change the value of the button

31517
19:56:25,720 --> 19:56:30,872
to be quote unquote Google search and if

31518
19:56:28,400 --> 19:56:33,280
I now go back here and reload I get a

31519
19:56:30,872 --> 19:56:35,720
fresh form and now I get a button that

31520
19:56:33,280 --> 19:56:37,192
literally says Google Search and if I

31521
19:56:35,720 --> 19:56:38,720
tinker with this further because this

31522
19:56:37,192 --> 19:56:41,871
isn't very user friendly there's even

31523
19:56:38,720 --> 19:56:46,120
more attributes I can do I can add on my

31524
19:56:41,872 --> 19:56:48,680
t uh search input a uh autoc complete

31525
19:56:46,120 --> 19:56:50,400
equals uh off if I don't want to see my

31526
19:56:48,680 --> 19:56:51,511
own history for whatever reason I don't

31527
19:56:50,400 --> 19:56:53,360
want people knowing I'm searching for

31528
19:56:51,512 --> 19:56:55,680
cats and dogs on this page I can

31529
19:56:53,360 --> 19:56:58,680
autofocus on the text box so that it

31530
19:56:55,680 --> 19:57:00,871
shows the cursor blinking in that box by

31531
19:56:58,680 --> 19:57:03,231
default and I can even do something like

31532
19:57:00,872 --> 19:57:05,160
this I can have a placeholder attribute

31533
19:57:03,232 --> 19:57:07,440
that says something like query or some

31534
19:57:05,160 --> 19:57:10,160
other documentation for the user and if

31535
19:57:07,440 --> 19:57:12,480
I now go back and reload you'll see

31536
19:57:10,160 --> 19:57:14,512
notice it says query and it's subtle but

31537
19:57:12,480 --> 19:57:17,280
my cursor is already positioned there it

31538
19:57:14,512 --> 19:57:18,760
gave it focus and I can type cats now

31539
19:57:17,280 --> 19:57:20,760
without having to click in the Box

31540
19:57:18,760 --> 19:57:23,871
manually which is just marginally better

31541
19:57:20,760 --> 19:57:27,231
for the user's experience any questions

31542
19:57:23,872 --> 19:57:29,232
now on all of this

31543
19:57:27,232 --> 19:57:31,160
here any

31544
19:57:29,232 --> 19:57:32,832
questions all right that too was a lot

31545
19:57:31,160 --> 19:57:34,360
why don't we take a casual five minute

31546
19:57:32,832 --> 19:57:36,400
break and when we resume we'll take a

31547
19:57:34,360 --> 19:57:39,800
look at CSS add in some JavaScript and

31548
19:57:36,400 --> 19:57:42,511
then wrap up so 5 minutes only for now

31549
19:57:39,800 --> 19:57:45,400
all right we are back so that's

31550
19:57:42,512 --> 19:57:47,080
technically it for HTML like here on out

31551
19:57:45,400 --> 19:57:48,480
it'll be up to like online resources and

31552
19:57:47,080 --> 19:57:50,280
references we point you to just to fill

31553
19:57:48,480 --> 19:57:52,159
in your vocabulary for more tags and

31554
19:57:50,280 --> 19:57:54,959
attributes but like conceptually that's

31555
19:57:52,160 --> 19:57:57,080
it there's attributes uh there are tags

31556
19:57:54,960 --> 19:57:58,872
and there are attributes and the rest of

31557
19:57:57,080 --> 19:58:01,360
it really is just kind of a laundry list

31558
19:57:58,872 --> 19:58:03,120
of capable uh possible features but it

31559
19:58:01,360 --> 19:58:05,320
turns out too you'll see over time that

31560
19:58:03,120 --> 19:58:08,920
you can even see the HTML for websit so

31561
19:58:05,320 --> 19:58:11,360
for instance if I go over to harvard.edu

31562
19:58:08,920 --> 19:58:13,040
in my browser which I'll go ahead in

31563
19:58:11,360 --> 19:58:13,920
just a moment here here and do here and

31564
19:58:13,040 --> 19:58:15,439
do

31565
19:58:13,920 --> 19:58:17,440
https

31566
19:58:15,440 --> 19:58:20,000
www.harvard.edu

31567
19:58:17,440 --> 19:58:22,000
enter it again will pull up today's

31568
19:58:20,000 --> 19:58:23,832
version of Harvard's website and if I

31569
19:58:22,000 --> 19:58:25,960
rightclick or control click on it again

31570
19:58:23,832 --> 19:58:28,832
and go to inspect you'll see those

31571
19:58:25,960 --> 19:58:30,832
so-called developer tools and earlier we

31572
19:58:28,832 --> 19:58:33,720
focused on the network tab just so we

31573
19:58:30,832 --> 19:58:35,552
could see the HTTP stuff going on but

31574
19:58:33,720 --> 19:58:38,192
what I glossed over earlier was the

31575
19:58:35,552 --> 19:58:41,120
so-called elements tab which actually

31576
19:58:38,192 --> 19:58:43,120
shows you the HTML underlying any web

31577
19:58:41,120 --> 19:58:45,319
page on the internet and so for instance

31578
19:58:43,120 --> 19:58:47,959
here is the underlying HTML for

31579
19:58:45,320 --> 19:58:49,120
Harvard's homepage as of right now and

31580
19:58:47,960 --> 19:58:50,800
aesthetically some of it's been

31581
19:58:49,120 --> 19:58:52,280
collapsed so if I click on these various

31582
19:58:50,800 --> 19:58:54,120
triangles I'll see what's actually

31583
19:58:52,280 --> 19:58:56,360
inside of that is the children of some

31584
19:58:54,120 --> 19:58:58,280
of these HTML tags but here on out if

31585
19:58:56,360 --> 19:59:01,360
you're ever curious as to like how a web

31586
19:58:58,280 --> 19:59:03,160
page uh made some feature visually you

31587
19:59:01,360 --> 19:59:04,832
can just literally use these developer

31588
19:59:03,160 --> 19:59:07,600
tools built into your own browser just

31589
19:59:04,832 --> 19:59:09,832
to see what the uh web developer

31590
19:59:07,600 --> 19:59:13,400
actually did and you can do things too

31591
19:59:09,832 --> 19:59:15,400
like this like if you really like maybe

31592
19:59:13,400 --> 19:59:17,192
uh let's see if you really like this

31593
19:59:15,400 --> 19:59:18,799
menu in the top right hand corner of

31594
19:59:17,192 --> 19:59:21,552
Harvard's website you can even

31595
19:59:18,800 --> 19:59:24,280
rightclick that or control click that

31596
19:59:21,552 --> 19:59:27,480
specifically choose inspect and what

31597
19:59:24,280 --> 19:59:29,680
browsers will do is jump to the HTML

31598
19:59:27,480 --> 19:59:31,512
corresponding to that visual element on

31599
19:59:29,680 --> 19:59:33,439
the page and here you can see though

31600
19:59:31,512 --> 19:59:35,720
we've not talked about this tag before

31601
19:59:33,440 --> 19:59:37,232
there's a button tag there's an ID

31602
19:59:35,720 --> 19:59:39,360
attribute and there's some other

31603
19:59:37,232 --> 19:59:42,232
attributes as well that Define that

31604
19:59:39,360 --> 19:59:44,832
button um you can do other things too in

31605
19:59:42,232 --> 19:59:46,280
the web page let me scroll down for

31606
19:59:44,832 --> 19:59:48,400
instance here and let's go actually

31607
19:59:46,280 --> 19:59:51,800
let's go to another one like yale.edu

31608
19:59:48,400 --> 19:59:55,760
here in today's theme and suppose we

31609
19:59:51,800 --> 19:59:58,232
want to do something like uh change the

31610
19:59:55,760 --> 20:00:00,000
Aesthetics of this website well let's do

31611
19:59:58,232 --> 20:00:02,552
how about this over here life at Yale

31612
20:00:00,000 --> 20:00:04,280
let's rightclick on this choose inspect

31613
20:00:02,552 --> 20:00:05,959
that's going to jump to that part of the

31614
20:00:04,280 --> 20:00:08,600
page and notice what you can do here in

31615
20:00:05,960 --> 20:00:10,872
this elements tab we can be a little a

31616
20:00:08,600 --> 20:00:13,800
little playful in return today life at

31617
20:00:10,872 --> 20:00:17,400
Harvard and voila we've now changed

31618
20:00:13,800 --> 20:00:19,552
Yale's website it would seem so have we

31619
20:00:17,400 --> 20:00:20,720
really like hopefully hacking is not

31620
20:00:19,552 --> 20:00:24,120
actually this

31621
20:00:20,720 --> 20:00:25,440
easy what did we actually do based on

31622
20:00:24,120 --> 20:00:28,640
today's mental

31623
20:00:25,440 --> 20:00:31,080
model like I have changed the page

31624
20:00:28,640 --> 20:00:32,480
but yeah just changed how it is for me

31625
20:00:31,080 --> 20:00:34,192
right because my browser just like with

31626
20:00:32,480 --> 20:00:36,080
Phyllis and Brian from the GetGo

31627
20:00:34,192 --> 20:00:38,512
requested Yale's web page I got back a

31628
20:00:36,080 --> 20:00:40,320
virtual envelope containing that HTML as

31629
20:00:38,512 --> 20:00:42,040
we've now called it my browser has a

31630
20:00:40,320 --> 20:00:43,920
local copy it's got its own tree

31631
20:00:42,040 --> 20:00:46,192
otherwise known as a Dom document object

31632
20:00:43,920 --> 20:00:48,512
model built up in its memory and yeah I

31633
20:00:46,192 --> 20:00:50,512
went to town and changed my copy of it

31634
20:00:48,512 --> 20:00:52,160
but of course hopefully I've not changed

31635
20:00:50,512 --> 20:00:55,800
the actual server and in fact if I

31636
20:00:52,160 --> 20:00:58,600
reload Yale's website now hopefully it

31637
20:00:55,800 --> 20:01:01,280
will revert back to indeed yep what it

31638
20:00:58,600 --> 20:01:03,600
should be instead life at Yale but this

31639
20:01:01,280 --> 20:01:05,512
ability in your own browser be it Chrome

31640
20:01:03,600 --> 20:01:07,000
or Firefox or Edge or Safari to have

31641
20:01:05,512 --> 20:01:08,400
these built-in developer tools are very

31642
20:01:07,000 --> 20:01:10,640
powerful because it's going to enable

31643
20:01:08,400 --> 20:01:12,231
you to not only diagnose problems that

31644
20:01:10,640 --> 20:01:14,080
will invariably arise in the coming

31645
20:01:12,232 --> 20:01:15,480
weeks with your own code but is also

31646
20:01:14,080 --> 20:01:17,232
going to allow you to learn from other

31647
20:01:15,480 --> 20:01:19,512
sites like how you can do things and

31648
20:01:17,232 --> 20:01:21,960
Tinker as well but up until now we

31649
20:01:19,512 --> 20:01:24,640
focused only on tags and attributes and

31650
20:01:21,960 --> 20:01:26,280
on the structure of a web page let's now

31651
20:01:24,640 --> 20:01:28,680
focus more on the Aesthetics and

31652
20:01:26,280 --> 20:01:31,232
fine-tuning that it turns out that HTML

31653
20:01:28,680 --> 20:01:33,799
has very limited support for anything

31654
20:01:31,232 --> 20:01:36,440
aesthetic like font sizes and colors and

31655
20:01:33,800 --> 20:01:38,600
so forth and in recent years people have

31656
20:01:36,440 --> 20:01:40,960
used necessarily a second language

31657
20:01:38,600 --> 20:01:43,280
called CSS not a programming language

31658
20:01:40,960 --> 20:01:45,160
again a markup language if you will to

31659
20:01:43,280 --> 20:01:47,440
just fine-tune the Aesthetics of a page

31660
20:01:45,160 --> 20:01:50,320
font sizes colors margins and all of

31661
20:01:47,440 --> 20:01:51,920
that so CSS is going to allow us to

31662
20:01:50,320 --> 20:01:53,440
define a whole bunch of properties which

31663
20:01:51,920 --> 20:01:56,440
is just another group of people's

31664
20:01:53,440 --> 20:01:57,920
terminology for key value pairs indeed

31665
20:01:56,440 --> 20:02:00,440
ever since week five like key value

31666
20:01:57,920 --> 20:02:02,280
pairs are everywhere in the world not

31667
20:02:00,440 --> 20:02:04,720
just at like sweet green and restaurants

31668
20:02:02,280 --> 20:02:07,120
but indeed under in line code and

31669
20:02:04,720 --> 20:02:09,480
languages and Technologies like these so

31670
20:02:07,120 --> 20:02:11,231
properties is the new word in CSS for

31671
20:02:09,480 --> 20:02:13,120
what a moment ago we called attributes

31672
20:02:11,232 --> 20:02:14,600
in H but it's the same idea just

31673
20:02:13,120 --> 20:02:17,832
different vocabulary that you get used

31674
20:02:14,600 --> 20:02:19,960
to over time a few phrases I might use

31675
20:02:17,832 --> 20:02:21,760
now and you'll hear in the coming days

31676
20:02:19,960 --> 20:02:23,720
would be these type selector class

31677
20:02:21,760 --> 20:02:25,720
selector ID selector attribute selector

31678
20:02:23,720 --> 20:02:27,320
which just refer to different techniques

31679
20:02:25,720 --> 20:02:29,600
we're about to see that are going to

31680
20:02:27,320 --> 20:02:31,552
allow you to control more precisely the

31681
20:02:29,600 --> 20:02:33,320
Aesthetics of specific things on the

31682
20:02:31,552 --> 20:02:35,440
page and the way we're going to do this

31683
20:02:33,320 --> 20:02:37,080
is we're going to take our basic HTML

31684
20:02:35,440 --> 20:02:38,640
like we saw earlier and we're going to

31685
20:02:37,080 --> 20:02:40,720
introduce in the next few minutes just a

31686
20:02:38,640 --> 20:02:43,160
couple of more tags and or attributes

31687
20:02:40,720 --> 20:02:45,920
one we're going to introduce you to a

31688
20:02:43,160 --> 20:02:48,280
tag called style which nicely named

31689
20:02:45,920 --> 20:02:50,480
allows you to um allows you to control

31690
20:02:48,280 --> 20:02:52,600
the style the Aesthetics the visuals of

31691
20:02:50,480 --> 20:02:55,552
the web page or we're going to introduce

31692
20:02:52,600 --> 20:02:57,320
you to a link tag which very confusingly

31693
20:02:55,552 --> 20:02:59,552
does not give you a link that you can

31694
20:02:57,320 --> 20:03:02,232
click on it just links to another file

31695
20:02:59,552 --> 20:03:04,512
that then gets automatically included or

31696
20:03:02,232 --> 20:03:06,760
imported to borrow our language from C

31697
20:03:04,512 --> 20:03:08,920
or in Python but same idea this will

31698
20:03:06,760 --> 20:03:10,720
allow us to include secondary files and

31699
20:03:08,920 --> 20:03:12,080
we're going to ultimately show you how

31700
20:03:10,720 --> 20:03:13,960
you can leverage third third party

31701
20:03:12,080 --> 20:03:15,720
Frameworks libraries that other people

31702
20:03:13,960 --> 20:03:17,280
wrote so as to not get stuck in the

31703
20:03:15,720 --> 20:03:18,800
weeds of all the fine tuning of

31704
20:03:17,280 --> 20:03:20,160
Aesthetics and just make pretty things

31705
20:03:18,800 --> 20:03:21,512
fast so you can focus really on the

31706
20:03:20,160 --> 20:03:23,480
intellectually interesting part if

31707
20:03:21,512 --> 20:03:25,680
that's your choice of building the

31708
20:03:23,480 --> 20:03:27,480
content the site out the application out

31709
20:03:25,680 --> 20:03:30,120
yourself all right so with that said let

31710
20:03:27,480 --> 20:03:32,040
me go back to vs code here and let me go

31711
20:03:30,120 --> 20:03:34,640
ahead and create a simple example called

31712
20:03:32,040 --> 20:03:36,871
home.html like a very simple homepage

31713
20:03:34,640 --> 20:03:39,232
for John Harvard for instance let me

31714
20:03:36,872 --> 20:03:41,000
give myself three paragraphs initially

31715
20:03:39,232 --> 20:03:43,360
the first of which is just going to have

31716
20:03:41,000 --> 20:03:44,720
uh the person name the second paragraph

31717
20:03:43,360 --> 20:03:45,920
is going to say something like welcome

31718
20:03:44,720 --> 20:03:48,320
to my

31719
20:03:45,920 --> 20:03:49,512
homepage uh to greet visitors and the

31720
20:03:48,320 --> 20:03:53,832
third is going to be like a little

31721
20:03:49,512 --> 20:03:57,232
footer like copyright uh how about John

31722
20:03:53,832 --> 20:03:58,871
Harvard 1636 or something like that all

31723
20:03:57,232 --> 20:04:01,320
right let me go back to my other tab as

31724
20:03:58,872 --> 20:04:04,360
before reload my index there's my new

31725
20:04:01,320 --> 20:04:06,160
file home.html and I'll click that and

31726
20:04:04,360 --> 20:04:08,760
you'll see okay I mean this is sort of

31727
20:04:06,160 --> 20:04:11,232
1636 style web page super simple all

31728
20:04:08,760 --> 20:04:12,080
text nothing really interesting going on

31729
20:04:11,232 --> 20:04:13,960
there

31730
20:04:12,080 --> 20:04:15,512
but we can start to style it a little

31731
20:04:13,960 --> 20:04:17,280
differently like if the title of the

31732
20:04:15,512 --> 20:04:18,680
page is John Harvard and then it's

31733
20:04:17,280 --> 20:04:20,480
welcome to my homepage and then this

31734
20:04:18,680 --> 20:04:22,832
less important footer why don't we have

31735
20:04:20,480 --> 20:04:24,440
the text be large then medium then small

31736
20:04:22,832 --> 20:04:27,040
so something arbitrary but a little more

31737
20:04:24,440 --> 20:04:30,872
nuanced so let me go back to vs code

31738
20:04:27,040 --> 20:04:33,719
here and in my home.html file let me

31739
20:04:30,872 --> 20:04:35,512
introduce not yet the style tag but what

31740
20:04:33,720 --> 20:04:37,920
I'm going to call temporarily the style

31741
20:04:35,512 --> 20:04:39,680
attribute both indeed exist this one's

31742
20:04:37,920 --> 20:04:41,480
simpler and it's going to be correct but

31743
20:04:39,680 --> 20:04:43,280
we'll see in a moment not as well

31744
20:04:41,480 --> 20:04:45,760
designed arguably as is often our

31745
20:04:43,280 --> 20:04:48,760
narrative so inside of the style tag you

31746
20:04:45,760 --> 20:04:50,599
can put this language called CSS key

31747
20:04:48,760 --> 20:04:52,159
value pairs otherwise known as

31748
20:04:50,600 --> 20:04:54,680
properties the only way you know what

31749
20:04:52,160 --> 20:04:56,360
properties exist what keys exist is by

31750
20:04:54,680 --> 20:04:57,552
taking a class reading a book looking at

31751
20:04:56,360 --> 20:04:59,192
an online reference and we're going to

31752
20:04:57,552 --> 20:05:01,040
give you just a sampling of what's out

31753
20:04:59,192 --> 20:05:03,720
there so suppose I want to control the

31754
20:05:01,040 --> 20:05:06,360
font size of this first paragraph I can

31755
20:05:03,720 --> 20:05:09,320
literally say font Das size in all lower

31756
20:05:06,360 --> 20:05:12,400
case colon and then a word like large or

31757
20:05:09,320 --> 20:05:13,960
I can specify 12p point or 18 point or

31758
20:05:12,400 --> 20:05:16,439
something more precise like that like

31759
20:05:13,960 --> 20:05:19,000
from Google Docs or Microsoft Word and

31760
20:05:16,440 --> 20:05:22,480
suppose I want to make this text down

31761
20:05:19,000 --> 20:05:25,680
here uh medium well uh I'll do quote

31762
20:05:22,480 --> 20:05:30,120
unquote font size colon medium and down

31763
20:05:25,680 --> 20:05:32,511
here I'll do style equals uh font Das

31764
20:05:30,120 --> 20:05:34,920
size small so I'm going to start with

31765
20:05:32,512 --> 20:05:37,192
just these three key value pairs same

31766
20:05:34,920 --> 20:05:38,800
key but different values I'll go back to

31767
20:05:37,192 --> 20:05:40,319
my page and in a moment I'll reload and

31768
20:05:38,800 --> 20:05:42,080
it's going to be somewhat subtle but

31769
20:05:40,320 --> 20:05:45,040
watch how the font size do change when I

31770
20:05:42,080 --> 20:05:46,920
reload now all right so got a little

31771
20:05:45,040 --> 20:05:49,000
bigger middle one's about the same and

31772
20:05:46,920 --> 20:05:50,640
the last one is a little smaller what if

31773
20:05:49,000 --> 20:05:52,680
I want to center it just like many web

31774
20:05:50,640 --> 20:05:54,400
pages have the text like this centered

31775
20:05:52,680 --> 20:05:56,120
well I can separate these key value

31776
20:05:54,400 --> 20:05:57,920
pairs with semicolons and I'm sorry

31777
20:05:56,120 --> 20:06:02,159
semicolons are kind of sort of back with

31778
20:05:57,920 --> 20:06:03,920
CSS but I can do text-align Colon Center

31779
20:06:02,160 --> 20:06:05,960
strictly speaking I don't need the last

31780
20:06:03,920 --> 20:06:07,552
semicolon if there's no more key value

31781
20:06:05,960 --> 20:06:10,960
pairs but I'll just do it to be

31782
20:06:07,552 --> 20:06:12,640
consistent uh text align Colon Center

31783
20:06:10,960 --> 20:06:16,720
and then down here after another

31784
20:06:12,640 --> 20:06:18,552
semicolon text align Colon Center all

31785
20:06:16,720 --> 20:06:20,760
right let's go back reload now it's

31786
20:06:18,552 --> 20:06:22,480
going to be much more obvious the change

31787
20:06:20,760 --> 20:06:24,319
and we now have the beginnings of a

31788
20:06:22,480 --> 20:06:26,280
homepage still pretty basic but at least

31789
20:06:24,320 --> 20:06:27,720
it's a little more interesting turns out

31790
20:06:26,280 --> 20:06:29,720
we can do a little better with the

31791
20:06:27,720 --> 20:06:31,480
copyright symbol like most computers

31792
20:06:29,720 --> 20:06:34,552
actually have support for a circle with

31793
20:06:31,480 --> 20:06:36,599
a c in it but you can't just do that

31794
20:06:34,552 --> 20:06:38,280
with uh text like this there's different

31795
20:06:36,600 --> 20:06:39,760
ways to do this you could copy paste it

31796
20:06:38,280 --> 20:06:41,232
from like a website that already has it

31797
20:06:39,760 --> 20:06:43,439
so you don't have to figure out the mag

31798
20:06:41,232 --> 20:06:45,040
iCal keystroke on your Mac or PC but

31799
20:06:43,440 --> 20:06:47,552
there's also in HTML what are called

31800
20:06:45,040 --> 20:06:51,040
entities and you can actually specify

31801
20:06:47,552 --> 20:06:54,512
using heximal or decimal codes numbers

31802
20:06:51,040 --> 20:06:57,159
like this H1 169 semicolon after an

31803
20:06:54,512 --> 20:06:58,600
Amper sand and this is a special symbol

31804
20:06:57,160 --> 20:07:00,160
that you can look up in any online

31805
20:06:58,600 --> 20:07:01,872
reference for like special characters

31806
20:07:00,160 --> 20:07:04,872
that are hard or impossible to type

31807
20:07:01,872 --> 20:07:06,680
manually at your keyboard and this let

31808
20:07:04,872 --> 20:07:08,440
me zoom in just so it's obvious if I

31809
20:07:06,680 --> 20:07:11,719
reload now instead of being two

31810
20:07:08,440 --> 20:07:14,192
parentheses and a c character

31811
20:07:11,720 --> 20:07:15,640
now it's a proper Copyright symbol so

31812
20:07:14,192 --> 20:07:17,280
you'll see these out there they're not

31813
20:07:15,640 --> 20:07:19,319
necessarily that frequently used

31814
20:07:17,280 --> 20:07:21,512
nowadays but it's good to know that they

31815
20:07:19,320 --> 20:07:24,600
exist but let me go back now to my code

31816
20:07:21,512 --> 20:07:27,360
and propose that while correct uh this

31817
20:07:24,600 --> 20:07:29,040
is arguably not very welld designed and

31818
20:07:27,360 --> 20:07:31,832
even if you've never seen HTML never

31819
20:07:29,040 --> 20:07:36,832
seen CSS before what Instinct might you

31820
20:07:31,832 --> 20:07:38,760
have for why this is poorly

31821
20:07:36,832 --> 20:07:41,400
designed

31822
20:07:38,760 --> 20:07:43,439
yeah there's repetition right in general

31823
20:07:41,400 --> 20:07:45,680
in the past several weeks see python SQL

31824
20:07:43,440 --> 20:07:47,800
like repetition generally bad and and

31825
20:07:45,680 --> 20:07:48,959
sloppy and it's not going to scale well

31826
20:07:47,800 --> 20:07:50,800
so the repetition I think you're

31827
20:07:48,960 --> 20:07:53,320
probably alluding to is textalign Center

31828
20:07:50,800 --> 20:07:56,640
textalign Center textalign Center well

31829
20:07:53,320 --> 20:07:59,760
we can factor that out in CSS the C in

31830
20:07:56,640 --> 20:08:01,800
CSS means cascading and this means that

31831
20:07:59,760 --> 20:08:04,871
if you move some properties to like a

31832
20:08:01,800 --> 20:08:07,040
parent or a grandparent uh the children

31833
20:08:04,872 --> 20:08:08,872
or grandchildren will inherit those

31834
20:08:07,040 --> 20:08:11,120
properties that is they will Cascade

31835
20:08:08,872 --> 20:08:12,920
down the family tree so to speak and so

31836
20:08:11,120 --> 20:08:15,319
so let me go ahead and remove all of

31837
20:08:12,920 --> 20:08:17,680
these since I claim they're indeed

31838
20:08:15,320 --> 20:08:20,920
redundant and let me preserve just one

31839
20:08:17,680 --> 20:08:22,920
of them by well let me do this it's not

31840
20:08:20,920 --> 20:08:24,720
quite right to put a a paragraph inside

31841
20:08:22,920 --> 20:08:26,480
of a paragraph like that's just not a

31842
20:08:24,720 --> 20:08:28,400
thing in English writing or in writing

31843
20:08:26,480 --> 20:08:30,760
more generally so I'm going to do one

31844
20:08:28,400 --> 20:08:32,439
thing first it turns out that these two

31845
20:08:30,760 --> 20:08:34,871
are arguably not paragraphs right this

31846
20:08:32,440 --> 20:08:37,320
is like a header the body the essence of

31847
20:08:34,872 --> 20:08:39,600
the page and then the footer so if a

31848
20:08:37,320 --> 20:08:41,320
paragraph isn't quite the right English

31849
20:08:39,600 --> 20:08:43,000
semantics you can actually use more

31850
20:08:41,320 --> 20:08:45,440
generically a tag that's all over the

31851
20:08:43,000 --> 20:08:47,760
internet called div for division of the

31852
20:08:45,440 --> 20:08:49,800
page and this is just a very generic

31853
20:08:47,760 --> 20:08:51,760
term for like a big rectangular region

31854
20:08:49,800 --> 20:08:53,192
that divides the page again and again

31855
20:08:51,760 --> 20:08:56,040
just so that you can think about

31856
20:08:53,192 --> 20:08:57,760
different regions now that I have div

31857
20:08:56,040 --> 20:08:59,192
which really has no more meaning than

31858
20:08:57,760 --> 20:09:01,231
that it's a division of the page

31859
20:08:59,192 --> 20:09:02,920
interpret as you will now I can have

31860
20:09:01,232 --> 20:09:05,640
multiple ones of these and let me go

31861
20:09:02,920 --> 20:09:08,160
ahead and open a div tag here let me

31862
20:09:05,640 --> 20:09:10,080
close a new div tag here and then just

31863
20:09:08,160 --> 20:09:11,720
to keep everything tidy I'm going to

31864
20:09:10,080 --> 20:09:13,640
highlight everything in between and hit

31865
20:09:11,720 --> 20:09:16,800
Tab and that just automatically indents

31866
20:09:13,640 --> 20:09:18,600
everything for me now I have a three

31867
20:09:16,800 --> 20:09:21,192
divs inside of another div and that's

31868
20:09:18,600 --> 20:09:23,320
totally fine this is very commonly done

31869
20:09:21,192 --> 20:09:26,760
now I'm going to do this style equals

31870
20:09:23,320 --> 20:09:29,832
quote unquote text align Colon Center

31871
20:09:26,760 --> 20:09:32,832
semicolon or not and now I have some

31872
20:09:29,832 --> 20:09:35,000
cascading capabilities now the parent of

31873
20:09:32,832 --> 20:09:36,680
those three children John Harvard welome

31874
20:09:35,000 --> 20:09:38,600
to my homepage and the copyright will

31875
20:09:36,680 --> 20:09:40,511
now all inherit that property so when I

31876
20:09:38,600 --> 20:09:42,872
hit reload nothing aesthetically has

31877
20:09:40,512 --> 20:09:45,360
changed whoops sorry

31878
20:09:42,872 --> 20:09:47,512
um I should have done reload slightly

31879
20:09:45,360 --> 20:09:49,320
earlier when you use a div instead of a

31880
20:09:47,512 --> 20:09:50,960
paragraph it actually gets rid of the

31881
20:09:49,320 --> 20:09:52,440
par uh the space between those

31882
20:09:50,960 --> 20:09:54,400
paragraphs it just sandwiches them a

31883
20:09:52,440 --> 20:09:57,000
little closer together I can fix this in

31884
20:09:54,400 --> 20:09:58,760
another way but that aside everything is

31885
20:09:57,000 --> 20:10:00,872
still centered and the text is still

31886
20:09:58,760 --> 20:10:02,760
large medium and small but I should have

31887
20:10:00,872 --> 20:10:04,400
called out that change in the paragraph

31888
20:10:02,760 --> 20:10:07,231
spacing but we could bring that back

31889
20:10:04,400 --> 20:10:09,599
before long if we wanted now what more

31890
20:10:07,232 --> 20:10:11,600
could I do to maybe improve this well

31891
20:10:09,600 --> 20:10:13,832
strictly speaking I don't really need

31892
20:10:11,600 --> 20:10:16,832
that parent div right because these

31893
20:10:13,832 --> 20:10:18,400
three divs inside already had a parent

31894
20:10:16,832 --> 20:10:20,871
so let me actually get rid of that new

31895
20:10:18,400 --> 20:10:22,319
div just undo what I did I'll highlight

31896
20:10:20,872 --> 20:10:24,920
this and if you haven't seen this trick

31897
20:10:22,320 --> 20:10:27,552
shift tab will unindent nicely which is

31898
20:10:24,920 --> 20:10:30,040
perhaps helpful I could just put that

31899
20:10:27,552 --> 20:10:34,512
text align Center on the body tag so

31900
20:10:30,040 --> 20:10:36,760
text align Colon Center quote unquote

31901
20:10:34,512 --> 20:10:38,640
this two would work as well so long as

31902
20:10:36,760 --> 20:10:40,920
you go up the family tree so to speak

31903
20:10:38,640 --> 20:10:43,800
reload and now indeed there's nothing

31904
20:10:40,920 --> 20:10:45,319
aesthetically that has changed this time

31905
20:10:43,800 --> 20:10:46,760
but it turns out nowadays the web is

31906
20:10:45,320 --> 20:10:47,960
getting a little more sophisticated and

31907
20:10:46,760 --> 20:10:49,871
even though you will see so many

31908
20:10:47,960 --> 20:10:52,512
examples online and tutorials and books

31909
20:10:49,872 --> 20:10:55,040
using div div div div all over the place

31910
20:10:52,512 --> 20:10:56,400
there are newer semantic tags semantic

31911
20:10:55,040 --> 20:10:58,231
just means they have more meaning than

31912
20:10:56,400 --> 20:11:01,640
this generic notion of a division and if

31913
20:10:58,232 --> 20:11:03,120
you look up the a documentation for HTML

31914
20:11:01,640 --> 20:11:05,760
you'll see that if you want to have a

31915
20:11:03,120 --> 20:11:07,799
header on a page not a heading like H1

31916
20:11:05,760 --> 20:11:10,000
H2 but a header there's literally

31917
20:11:07,800 --> 20:11:12,080
nowadays a header tag and this is

31918
20:11:10,000 --> 20:11:14,040
marginally better because it now says

31919
20:11:12,080 --> 20:11:16,080
what it is search engines like Google

31920
20:11:14,040 --> 20:11:17,599
and Bing can detect oh that's the header

31921
20:11:16,080 --> 20:11:19,000
of the page maybe we should use this and

31922
20:11:17,600 --> 20:11:21,120
give it more prominence in the search

31923
20:11:19,000 --> 20:11:23,232
results you can then have a main part of

31924
20:11:21,120 --> 20:11:25,280
the page so literally a tag called main

31925
20:11:23,232 --> 20:11:27,232
nowadays you can literally have a footer

31926
20:11:25,280 --> 20:11:29,800
of the page and again these are often

31927
20:11:27,232 --> 20:11:31,160
useful for screen readers to help recite

31928
20:11:29,800 --> 20:11:32,920
things verbally for folks who might

31929
20:11:31,160 --> 20:11:35,040
otherwise not be able to read them and

31930
20:11:32,920 --> 20:11:37,000
probably these screen readers might

31931
20:11:35,040 --> 20:11:38,719
highlight the header and the main part

31932
20:11:37,000 --> 20:11:40,400
but maybe not might not spend time for

31933
20:11:38,720 --> 20:11:42,400
the user on the footer which is arguably

31934
20:11:40,400 --> 20:11:45,192
a little less important semantically

31935
20:11:42,400 --> 20:11:46,799
usually um or search engines again now

31936
20:11:45,192 --> 20:11:48,280
know what's the header what's the footer

31937
20:11:46,800 --> 20:11:50,680
what's the main part of the page so they

31938
20:11:48,280 --> 20:11:52,800
know what to search and analyze so this

31939
20:11:50,680 --> 20:11:54,871
would arguably be a a better design

31940
20:11:52,800 --> 20:11:58,680
nowadays as

31941
20:11:54,872 --> 20:12:00,600
well but what else remains as a problem

31942
20:11:58,680 --> 20:12:02,599
well this is now getting a little bit

31943
20:12:00,600 --> 20:12:05,160
more subtle and takes some experience

31944
20:12:02,600 --> 20:12:07,400
but this practice of putting HTML and

31945
20:12:05,160 --> 20:12:09,320
CSS all in the same file it's a little

31946
20:12:07,400 --> 20:12:11,360
sloppy why because it means I'm

31947
20:12:09,320 --> 20:12:13,160
co-mingling my data with the

31948
20:12:11,360 --> 20:12:15,192
presentation thereof like the juicy

31949
20:12:13,160 --> 20:12:17,080
stuff I care about like John Harvard and

31950
20:12:15,192 --> 20:12:18,920
the phrase welcome to my homepage and

31951
20:12:17,080 --> 20:12:21,080
all of the Aesthetics that I might want

31952
20:12:18,920 --> 20:12:23,480
to change over time and honestly because

31953
20:12:21,080 --> 20:12:24,680
everything is currently in one big file

31954
20:12:23,480 --> 20:12:26,760
it's going to make it really hard for me

31955
20:12:24,680 --> 20:12:28,871
to collaborate with a classmate or a

31956
20:12:26,760 --> 20:12:31,120
colleague at work so that maybe I do the

31957
20:12:28,872 --> 20:12:32,640
HTML they do the CSS like uhuh not if

31958
20:12:31,120 --> 20:12:34,760
you're all working in the same file it

31959
20:12:32,640 --> 20:12:36,480
would be a nightmare even if you use vs

31960
20:12:34,760 --> 20:12:38,159
code sharing feature like Google Docs

31961
20:12:36,480 --> 20:12:39,720
and both are typing at the same time

31962
20:12:38,160 --> 20:12:41,552
like you're going to mess up somehow

31963
20:12:39,720 --> 20:12:43,872
it'd be nice if we could separate these

31964
20:12:41,552 --> 20:12:45,832
two languages well one way to do that

31965
20:12:43,872 --> 20:12:48,720
would be as follows let me get rid of

31966
20:12:45,832 --> 20:12:50,871
all of the style tags sorry style

31967
20:12:48,720 --> 20:12:54,512
attributes that I've added up until

31968
20:12:50,872 --> 20:12:57,480
now on all four now of these tags and

31969
20:12:54,512 --> 20:13:00,040
let me introduce the style tag that we

31970
20:12:57,480 --> 20:13:01,920
saw on the slide earlier instead I'm

31971
20:13:00,040 --> 20:13:03,439
going to go up here into the head of the

31972
20:13:01,920 --> 20:13:05,680
page which is where technically these

31973
20:13:03,440 --> 20:13:07,640
style tags must go so that they're

31974
20:13:05,680 --> 20:13:10,120
already loaded into memory before the

31975
20:13:07,640 --> 20:13:12,400
body is even analyzed by the browser and

31976
20:13:10,120 --> 20:13:15,959
inside of the the style tag I'm actually

31977
20:13:12,400 --> 20:13:18,720
going to select the HTML elements that I

31978
20:13:15,960 --> 20:13:20,760
want to stylize if you will so if I want

31979
20:13:18,720 --> 20:13:22,080
to change the body's Aesthetics I'm

31980
20:13:20,760 --> 20:13:25,231
going to literally type the name of that

31981
20:13:22,080 --> 20:13:28,160
tag body and then I'm sorry curly braces

31982
20:13:25,232 --> 20:13:31,440
are back also from c u inside of these

31983
20:13:28,160 --> 20:13:33,232
curly braces I'm going to put text align

31984
20:13:31,440 --> 20:13:35,000
Center so the key value pairs are the

31985
20:13:33,232 --> 20:13:37,160
same the only new thing I've done is

31986
20:13:35,000 --> 20:13:39,760
I've moved some of the syntax up to this

31987
20:13:37,160 --> 20:13:42,512
new style tag in the head if I want to

31988
20:13:39,760 --> 20:13:44,319
now control the header tag as well I can

31989
20:13:42,512 --> 20:13:46,040
use the same curly braces this is

31990
20:13:44,320 --> 20:13:48,080
convention to put the open curly brace

31991
20:13:46,040 --> 20:13:49,959
on the same line the closed curly brace

31992
20:13:48,080 --> 20:13:52,040
on another the browser doesn't really

31993
20:13:49,960 --> 20:13:54,440
care but this is a common CSS style

31994
20:13:52,040 --> 20:13:57,511
convention I'm going to do font size

31995
20:13:54,440 --> 20:14:00,440
large semicolon then for the main tag

31996
20:13:57,512 --> 20:14:02,400
I'm going to do font size medium and

31997
20:14:00,440 --> 20:14:05,960
then for the footer tag I'm going to do

31998
20:14:02,400 --> 20:14:07,439
font size small so same exact thing and

31999
20:14:05,960 --> 20:14:09,120
it's admittedly a little bit more

32000
20:14:07,440 --> 20:14:10,640
verbose it's taking up more lines of

32001
20:14:09,120 --> 20:14:13,319
code it doesn't all quite fit on the

32002
20:14:10,640 --> 20:14:15,280
screen but if you scroll back down now

32003
20:14:13,320 --> 20:14:17,440
and you'll acquire an eye for this this

32004
20:14:15,280 --> 20:14:19,640
is just better like it's just more

32005
20:14:17,440 --> 20:14:21,640
compact it's more readable the the

32006
20:14:19,640 --> 20:14:24,440
content the data jumps out and there's

32007
20:14:21,640 --> 20:14:27,120
no visual distractions like the CSS

32008
20:14:24,440 --> 20:14:29,512
properties as before upside here too is

32009
20:14:27,120 --> 20:14:30,959
that we don't actually need to uh this

32010
20:14:29,512 --> 20:14:33,232
doesn't actually change the Aesthetics

32011
20:14:30,960 --> 20:14:35,680
if I reload the same page it still looks

32012
20:14:33,232 --> 20:14:37,872
the same but I've taken a step toward

32013
20:14:35,680 --> 20:14:39,439
some slightly better design but let me

32014
20:14:37,872 --> 20:14:42,832
propose that there's other ways to do

32015
20:14:39,440 --> 20:14:45,800
this too we just selected things by way

32016
20:14:42,832 --> 20:14:47,319
of their uh type so that was a so-called

32017
20:14:45,800 --> 20:14:50,640
type selector when I literally just

32018
20:14:47,320 --> 20:14:53,360
specifi the type of tag body header main

32019
20:14:50,640 --> 20:14:54,872
footer but there's other ways that now

32020
20:14:53,360 --> 20:14:57,440
we can lay the foundation for making

32021
20:14:54,872 --> 20:15:00,080
reusable CSS that you and colleagues and

32022
20:14:57,440 --> 20:15:02,512
classmates can use and reuse in multiple

32023
20:15:00,080 --> 20:15:04,120
files and even in multiple projects so

32024
20:15:02,512 --> 20:15:06,080
let me actually go ahead and do this

32025
20:15:04,120 --> 20:15:08,231
instead of just very explicitly saying I

32026
20:15:06,080 --> 20:15:10,832
want the body to be centered let me

32027
20:15:08,232 --> 20:15:13,552
invent an adjective if you will and let

32028
20:15:10,832 --> 20:15:16,720
me change this to do centered and this

32029
20:15:13,552 --> 20:15:19,640
new uh this new vocabulary word centered

32030
20:15:16,720 --> 20:15:21,720
will literally mean texal Center let me

32031
20:15:19,640 --> 20:15:24,680
go ahead here and I'm just going to

32032
20:15:21,720 --> 20:15:27,400
create a new adjective called large a

32033
20:15:24,680 --> 20:15:29,640
new adjective called medium and a new

32034
20:15:27,400 --> 20:15:31,799
adjective called small they are

32035
20:15:29,640 --> 20:15:34,040
deliberately consistent with what the

32036
20:15:31,800 --> 20:15:36,680
properties do but these are now my own

32037
20:15:34,040 --> 20:15:39,599
vocabulary words and they are called

32038
20:15:36,680 --> 20:15:41,120
classes so a class is just a collection

32039
20:15:39,600 --> 20:15:42,800
of key value

32040
20:15:41,120 --> 20:15:45,400
a collection of properties that you get

32041
20:15:42,800 --> 20:15:48,832
to invent for yourself and what it lets

32042
20:15:45,400 --> 20:15:51,360
you do now is this now if I want the

32043
20:15:48,832 --> 20:15:52,920
whole body to be centered I can add this

32044
20:15:51,360 --> 20:15:56,600
tag which we actually saw briefly in

32045
20:15:52,920 --> 20:15:57,920
Yale's HTML class equals centered down

32046
20:15:56,600 --> 20:16:00,232
here in the header if I want this to be

32047
20:15:57,920 --> 20:16:02,512
large I can say class equals quote

32048
20:16:00,232 --> 20:16:05,832
unquote large down here on Main I can

32049
20:16:02,512 --> 20:16:07,960
say class equals quote unquote medium

32050
20:16:05,832 --> 20:16:10,080
and down here I can have class equals

32051
20:16:07,960 --> 20:16:12,512
quote unquote small now I have taken one

32052
20:16:10,080 --> 20:16:14,800
step backward by read addding some of

32053
20:16:12,512 --> 20:16:16,720
the Aesthetics to the page but it's not

32054
20:16:14,800 --> 20:16:18,600
the actual properties it's not the key

32055
20:16:16,720 --> 20:16:20,192
value pairs it's now more semantically

32056
20:16:18,600 --> 20:16:22,640
nice because now I just know from

32057
20:16:20,192 --> 20:16:23,920
reading the HTML what these things are

32058
20:16:22,640 --> 20:16:26,080
going to look like whereas the

32059
20:16:23,920 --> 20:16:28,360
implementation details for all four of

32060
20:16:26,080 --> 20:16:30,080
those adjectives is now relegated up

32061
20:16:28,360 --> 20:16:32,192
above and these are literally my words I

32062
20:16:30,080 --> 20:16:34,160
could change it to Fu and use class

32063
20:16:32,192 --> 20:16:35,599
equals quote unquote Foo but obviously

32064
20:16:34,160 --> 20:16:39,320
that would not be the best choice of

32065
20:16:35,600 --> 20:16:42,680
words in this case all right any

32066
20:16:39,320 --> 20:16:46,000
questions on this this now is what we

32067
20:16:42,680 --> 20:16:47,480
would call a class selector by using

32068
20:16:46,000 --> 20:16:49,680
literally the dot even though the dot

32069
20:16:47,480 --> 20:16:51,192
does not appear elsewhere but dot means

32070
20:16:49,680 --> 20:16:53,511
this is a

32071
20:16:51,192 --> 20:16:55,040
class these are not always the best

32072
20:16:53,512 --> 20:16:57,192
syntactic design decisions that the

32073
20:16:55,040 --> 20:16:59,480
world makes all right well one last

32074
20:16:57,192 --> 20:17:01,080
trick then notice that this is a little

32075
20:16:59,480 --> 20:17:02,760
Annoying that I'm still working in the

32076
20:17:01,080 --> 20:17:04,480
same file and if my classmate wants to

32077
20:17:02,760 --> 20:17:06,000
clean up my Aesthetics make my homepage

32078
20:17:04,480 --> 20:17:07,872
look way better if my colleague wants to

32079
20:17:06,000 --> 20:17:09,760
do the same wouldn't it be nice if we

32080
20:17:07,872 --> 20:17:11,720
could actually move all of this code to

32081
20:17:09,760 --> 20:17:14,760
a different function file like a python

32082
20:17:11,720 --> 20:17:17,232
library or a c header file well you can

32083
20:17:14,760 --> 20:17:20,319
let me go ahead and delete that whole

32084
20:17:17,232 --> 20:17:24,232
style tag let me add a confusingly named

32085
20:17:20,320 --> 20:17:28,232
link tag the href of which let's call a

32086
20:17:24,232 --> 20:17:30,440
new file styles.css and let's say that

32087
20:17:28,232 --> 20:17:32,760
the relationship of that file is that of

32088
20:17:30,440 --> 20:17:34,320
stylesheet so this is a term of Art in

32089
20:17:32,760 --> 20:17:36,280
the world of web development a

32090
20:17:34,320 --> 20:17:38,800
stylesheet is a text file that contains

32091
20:17:36,280 --> 20:17:41,319
lots of styles lots of CSS properties

32092
20:17:38,800 --> 20:17:44,760
let me open my terminal real fast

32093
20:17:41,320 --> 20:17:46,872
and let me do code of

32094
20:17:44,760 --> 20:17:49,040
styles.css

32095
20:17:46,872 --> 20:17:51,440
enter and in this file I'm going to

32096
20:17:49,040 --> 20:17:53,319
paste all of those same lines as earlier

32097
20:17:51,440 --> 20:17:55,080
but now they're in a separate file and

32098
20:17:53,320 --> 20:17:56,832
indeed if I hide my terminal window and

32099
20:17:55,080 --> 20:17:58,360
I give this file to a colleague they can

32100
20:17:56,832 --> 20:17:59,799
now work on the Aesthetics of the page

32101
20:17:58,360 --> 20:18:01,552
and make things a lot prettier than this

32102
20:17:59,800 --> 20:18:04,320
maybe use specific font sizes maybe add

32103
20:18:01,552 --> 20:18:06,640
colors and the like whereas I can focus

32104
20:18:04,320 --> 20:18:08,720
entirely on the HTML because this file

32105
20:18:06,640 --> 20:18:10,760
now will reference that other and if I

32106
20:18:08,720 --> 20:18:12,360
go back to my other Tab and reload Cod

32107
20:18:10,760 --> 20:18:15,400
the content's going to be exactly the

32108
20:18:12,360 --> 20:18:17,640
same but now I'm using some separate

32109
20:18:15,400 --> 20:18:20,760
file

32110
20:18:17,640 --> 20:18:22,960
instead any questions now about these

32111
20:18:20,760 --> 20:18:26,920
techniques

32112
20:18:22,960 --> 20:18:29,192
here no all right so with that said let

32113
20:18:26,920 --> 20:18:31,040
me show just one example now of what I

32114
20:18:29,192 --> 20:18:32,480
called a moment ago Frameworks and this

32115
20:18:31,040 --> 20:18:33,920
is where web development gets kind of

32116
20:18:32,480 --> 20:18:35,640
fun at least if you like this especially

32117
20:18:33,920 --> 20:18:37,040
if you like the sort of logical design

32118
20:18:35,640 --> 20:18:38,400
the presentation of information you care

32119
20:18:37,040 --> 20:18:40,192
about but you really don't want to

32120
20:18:38,400 --> 20:18:41,920
struggle with like font sizes and colors

32121
20:18:40,192 --> 20:18:44,280
and getting everything Pixel Perfect so

32122
20:18:41,920 --> 20:18:46,640
to speak let me propose that I open up

32123
20:18:44,280 --> 20:18:49,640
here an example in just a moment in vs

32124
20:18:46,640 --> 20:18:53,600
code that I prepared in advance and this

32125
20:18:49,640 --> 20:18:55,232
one is going to be an opportunity to

32126
20:18:53,600 --> 20:18:58,040
consider how you might take some of the

32127
20:18:55,232 --> 20:19:00,280
data from last week which we had wherein

32128
20:18:58,040 --> 20:19:02,799
we collected everyone's favorites and

32129
20:19:00,280 --> 20:19:03,959
lay it out in a really big HTML table so

32130
20:19:02,800 --> 20:19:05,360
I wrote this out in advance because it

32131
20:19:03,960 --> 20:19:07,160
was a huge amount of data but it's the

32132
20:19:05,360 --> 20:19:09,160
same data from the Google form from last

32133
20:19:07,160 --> 20:19:12,080
week and you'll see already the hints of

32134
20:19:09,160 --> 20:19:14,160
a table tag and these TRS and I added a

32135
20:19:12,080 --> 20:19:15,512
few other tags for Aesthetics it turns

32136
20:19:14,160 --> 20:19:17,552
out when you have a more visually

32137
20:19:15,512 --> 20:19:19,400
interesting header for your table

32138
20:19:17,552 --> 20:19:21,192
there's another tag called T head

32139
20:19:19,400 --> 20:19:22,511
there's another tag called T body these

32140
20:19:21,192 --> 20:19:23,720
are not all that intellectually

32141
20:19:22,512 --> 20:19:25,512
interesting I just read the

32142
20:19:23,720 --> 20:19:27,680
documentation and realized oh to make

32143
20:19:25,512 --> 20:19:29,960
things prettier I need a t head a t body

32144
20:19:27,680 --> 20:19:32,552
and so forth but what's interesting here

32145
20:19:29,960 --> 20:19:35,192
is that if I go to my index here and

32146
20:19:32,552 --> 20:19:37,360
open this file called favorites. HTML

32147
20:19:35,192 --> 20:19:39,599
here is all of the data from last week's

32148
20:19:37,360 --> 20:19:42,480
Google spreadsheet which we exported as

32149
20:19:39,600 --> 20:19:45,480
CS and I manually before class converted

32150
20:19:42,480 --> 20:19:47,159
to just HTML it's indeed a table but

32151
20:19:45,480 --> 20:19:48,959
it's really not pretty like the columns

32152
20:19:47,160 --> 20:19:51,000
are really close together it's kind of

32153
20:19:48,960 --> 20:19:53,680
hard to distinguish one row from another

32154
20:19:51,000 --> 20:19:55,720
but this is just raw HTML written by me

32155
20:19:53,680 --> 20:19:58,000
now I could use CSS and some of the

32156
20:19:55,720 --> 20:19:59,920
tricks we just saw to maybe change font

32157
20:19:58,000 --> 20:20:01,440
size there's ways to change color

32158
20:19:59,920 --> 20:20:04,080
background color and a lot of things

32159
20:20:01,440 --> 20:20:05,800
like that but honestly other surely

32160
20:20:04,080 --> 20:20:07,800
other people in the world have presented

32161
20:20:05,800 --> 20:20:09,400
tabular data in pretty ways right I've

32162
20:20:07,800 --> 20:20:12,160
been to many websites that have prettier

32163
20:20:09,400 --> 20:20:15,640
tables than M can I maybe use someone

32164
20:20:12,160 --> 20:20:17,800
else's framework someone else's CSS

32165
20:20:15,640 --> 20:20:19,720
include it in my page but then stand on

32166
20:20:17,800 --> 20:20:22,080
their shoulders and just make my stuff

32167
20:20:19,720 --> 20:20:24,832
look prettier well I dare say I can let

32168
20:20:22,080 --> 20:20:27,160
me go ahead here and semi secretly open

32169
20:20:24,832 --> 20:20:29,640
up vs code again and let me grab a

32170
20:20:27,160 --> 20:20:32,720
slightly different version of favorites.

32171
20:20:29,640 --> 20:20:37,040
HTML that I also opened in advance

32172
20:20:32,720 --> 20:20:38,760
wherein I add this line of code instead

32173
20:20:37,040 --> 20:20:40,719
give me just a moment to foreground this

32174
20:20:38,760 --> 20:20:42,832
version and the data is is all the same

32175
20:20:40,720 --> 20:20:45,040
as before but I've added one of these

32176
20:20:42,832 --> 20:20:48,511
link tags and I'm not linking to my own

32177
20:20:45,040 --> 20:20:51,000
styles.css I'm using a popular Library

32178
20:20:48,512 --> 20:20:52,920
called bootstrap and bootstrap is just

32179
20:20:51,000 --> 20:20:55,232
one of many popular libraries out there

32180
20:20:52,920 --> 20:20:57,552
free at that that has a whole bunch of

32181
20:20:55,232 --> 20:20:59,640
CSS files and soon JavaScript files that

32182
20:20:57,552 --> 20:21:01,720
you can just use for free in your own

32183
20:20:59,640 --> 20:21:04,400
projects personally or professionally

32184
20:21:01,720 --> 20:21:06,192
that just make things look and behave

32185
20:21:04,400 --> 20:21:09,040
better without you having to reinvent

32186
20:21:06,192 --> 20:21:10,552
Wheels now to access their CSS I had to

32187
20:21:09,040 --> 20:21:12,832
read their documentation and grab this

32188
20:21:10,552 --> 20:21:15,360
very long URL here but it's the same

32189
20:21:12,832 --> 20:21:17,400
idea link a forre equals quote unquote

32190
20:21:15,360 --> 20:21:19,640
something and I read their documentation

32191
20:21:17,400 --> 20:21:21,599
and they told me to add this they told

32192
20:21:19,640 --> 20:21:24,192
me that if I want my tables to be

32193
20:21:21,600 --> 20:21:27,080
prettier I have to add a class attribute

32194
20:21:24,192 --> 20:21:29,000
to my own table tag and specify a little

32195
20:21:27,080 --> 20:21:31,440
weirdly but this is what bootstrap told

32196
20:21:29,000 --> 20:21:33,680
me to do a class called table and that

32197
20:21:31,440 --> 20:21:35,680
will make it a prettier bootstrap table

32198
20:21:33,680 --> 20:21:37,760
and if I want to stripe it like every

32199
20:21:35,680 --> 20:21:39,959
other row is gray instead of white just

32200
20:21:37,760 --> 20:21:41,959
to make it pop a little more visually I

32201
20:21:39,960 --> 20:21:45,320
can also add a second class separated by

32202
20:21:41,960 --> 20:21:47,640
a space called table striped that's all

32203
20:21:45,320 --> 20:21:50,080
I did I added line five and I changed

32204
20:21:47,640 --> 20:21:52,280
line nine and that is it the rest of the

32205
20:21:50,080 --> 20:21:54,720
hundreds of lines in favorites. HTML are

32206
20:21:52,280 --> 20:21:56,760
the same but if I go back here now and

32207
20:21:54,720 --> 20:21:59,960
reload the browser now thanks to

32208
20:21:56,760 --> 20:22:01,552
bootstrap voila like it's much prettier

32209
20:21:59,960 --> 20:22:03,512
now I can zoom out and that changes the

32210
20:22:01,552 --> 20:22:05,720
font size just locally for me and even

32211
20:22:03,512 --> 20:22:08,192
if you don't love their Aesthetics I

32212
20:22:05,720 --> 20:22:10,080
mean this is easily better than my own

32213
20:22:08,192 --> 20:22:12,040
there and it turns out we can can do

32214
20:22:10,080 --> 20:22:14,480
even better by adding interactivity to

32215
20:22:12,040 --> 20:22:16,552
this too but to do that we're going to

32216
20:22:14,480 --> 20:22:18,440
need one final language for today and

32217
20:22:16,552 --> 20:22:20,080
this one is an actual programming

32218
20:22:18,440 --> 20:22:22,120
language and we won't use it all that

32219
20:22:20,080 --> 20:22:24,160
much in cs50 but we introduce it here as

32220
20:22:22,120 --> 20:22:26,192
we begin web stuff because there's just

32221
20:22:24,160 --> 20:22:27,640
so many free libraries and professional

32222
20:22:26,192 --> 20:22:30,120
libraries that you can use just to make

32223
20:22:27,640 --> 20:22:32,552
your web applications fancier and more

32224
20:22:30,120 --> 20:22:36,192
interactive mobile applications as well

32225
20:22:32,552 --> 20:22:38,440
increasingly use HTML CSS and JavaScript

32226
20:22:36,192 --> 20:22:41,000
to power our iPhones and Android devices

32227
20:22:38,440 --> 20:22:42,600
as well so a quick tour some syntax and

32228
20:22:41,000 --> 20:22:44,400
then we'll conclude with just some

32229
20:22:42,600 --> 20:22:46,872
hopefully inspiring examples to give you

32230
20:22:44,400 --> 20:22:49,000
a taste of what JavaScript can do so

32231
20:22:46,872 --> 20:22:51,480
JavaScript supports conditionals just

32232
20:22:49,000 --> 20:22:53,552
like C and python before it if we rewind

32233
20:22:51,480 --> 20:22:55,360
to our scratch days here of course is a

32234
20:22:53,552 --> 20:22:57,440
conditional here is the corresponding

32235
20:22:55,360 --> 20:23:00,040
JavaScript code as of today it's pretty

32236
20:22:57,440 --> 20:23:03,320
much identical to see with the syntax

32237
20:23:00,040 --> 20:23:04,871
here uh if we had an if an if else in

32238
20:23:03,320 --> 20:23:06,280
scratch it looked like this in

32239
20:23:04,872 --> 20:23:08,232
JavaScript it's going to look like this

32240
20:23:06,280 --> 20:23:10,800
instead so it's a bit of a regression V

32241
20:23:08,232 --> 20:23:12,320
ofv python like the the parentheses are

32242
20:23:10,800 --> 20:23:14,320
back the curly braces are back the

32243
20:23:12,320 --> 20:23:16,400
semicolons I mentioned in CSS are also

32244
20:23:14,320 --> 20:23:18,160
back in JavaScript potentially but it's

32245
20:23:16,400 --> 20:23:19,599
familiar is the point here and it's a

32246
20:23:18,160 --> 20:23:22,232
different language that's frequently

32247
20:23:19,600 --> 20:23:23,872
used for the web whereas you can't use

32248
20:23:22,232 --> 20:23:26,000
python in the ways we're about to use

32249
20:23:23,872 --> 20:23:28,512
JavaScript it just wasn't designed for

32250
20:23:26,000 --> 20:23:32,080
that purpose meanwhile if you have an if

32251
20:23:28,512 --> 20:23:33,832
El it's else if else in scratch well in

32252
20:23:32,080 --> 20:23:35,760
JavaScript just like in C it's going to

32253
20:23:33,832 --> 20:23:37,511
look like this instead variables in

32254
20:23:35,760 --> 20:23:39,080
JavaScript of course are a thing too and

32255
20:23:37,512 --> 20:23:42,160
in scratch we might have initialized a

32256
20:23:39,080 --> 20:23:44,280
counter variable to Z in JavaScript a

32257
20:23:42,160 --> 20:23:46,080
few different ways to do this and just

32258
20:23:44,280 --> 20:23:47,959
the for now the keyword is let it's sort

32259
20:23:46,080 --> 20:23:51,192
of a polite way of asking for a variable

32260
20:23:47,960 --> 20:23:52,960
let uh counter equal zero semicolon so

32261
20:23:51,192 --> 20:23:54,680
you don't mention the type but you do

32262
20:23:52,960 --> 20:23:56,800
use a keyword here in this case called

32263
20:23:54,680 --> 20:23:59,040
let if you want to increment counter by

32264
20:23:56,800 --> 20:24:01,400
one few different ways in JavaScript you

32265
20:23:59,040 --> 20:24:03,079
can do this just like in C in JavaScript

32266
20:24:01,400 --> 20:24:05,192
you can do this just like in C and in

32267
20:24:03,080 --> 20:24:07,160
Python in JavaScript you can also get

32268
20:24:05,192 --> 20:24:09,440
this so plus plus is back so maybe that

32269
20:24:07,160 --> 20:24:11,600
counterbalances the other syntax as well

32270
20:24:09,440 --> 20:24:14,040
that was was not the case in Python

32271
20:24:11,600 --> 20:24:15,400
Loops are back of course in JavaScript

32272
20:24:14,040 --> 20:24:17,480
whereas in scratch you could repeat

32273
20:24:15,400 --> 20:24:19,159
three times like this in JavaScript it's

32274
20:24:17,480 --> 20:24:20,832
pretty much just like C the only

32275
20:24:19,160 --> 20:24:23,440
difference here is that you say let

32276
20:24:20,832 --> 20:24:24,599
instead of int for an example like this

32277
20:24:23,440 --> 20:24:26,680
meanwhile if you want to do something

32278
20:24:24,600 --> 20:24:29,480
forever in scratch in JavaScript just

32279
20:24:26,680 --> 20:24:32,000
like in C you say while true in this

32280
20:24:29,480 --> 20:24:33,760
case so this is to say we're sort of

32281
20:24:32,000 --> 20:24:35,400
comfortable spending relatively little

32282
20:24:33,760 --> 20:24:37,799
time on JavaScript at least for today's

32283
20:24:35,400 --> 20:24:40,511
purposes because syntactically it's

32284
20:24:37,800 --> 20:24:42,232
really the same as we've seen before

32285
20:24:40,512 --> 20:24:44,040
with maybe a slight variance here or

32286
20:24:42,232 --> 20:24:45,960
there but what's interesting today

32287
20:24:44,040 --> 20:24:49,159
arguably is just what kinds of things

32288
20:24:45,960 --> 20:24:51,720
you can do with it so with that said

32289
20:24:49,160 --> 20:24:54,280
what kinds of things can we do it's all

32290
20:24:51,720 --> 20:24:56,360
comes back to this picture if this is a

32291
20:24:54,280 --> 20:24:59,360
simple web page on the left and this is

32292
20:24:56,360 --> 20:25:00,800
the corresponding tree or Dom document

32293
20:24:59,360 --> 20:25:02,552
object model on the right that is the

32294
20:25:00,800 --> 20:25:05,512
tree the browser automatically creates

32295
20:25:02,552 --> 20:25:07,680
in memory or RAM for you JavaScript is

32296
20:25:05,512 --> 20:25:10,760
now a proper programming language that

32297
20:25:07,680 --> 20:25:13,192
lets us dynamically manipul ulate like

32298
20:25:10,760 --> 20:25:14,720
read data from this change this and this

32299
20:25:13,192 --> 20:25:16,871
is how Google for instance implements

32300
20:25:14,720 --> 20:25:20,480
your inbox they might have uh in your

32301
20:25:16,872 --> 20:25:21,800
inbox it's like a table so TR TR TR TR

32302
20:25:20,480 --> 20:25:24,552
probably something like that or heck

32303
20:25:21,800 --> 20:25:26,040
maybe div div div div using JavaScript

32304
20:25:24,552 --> 20:25:28,231
anytime they realize someone sent you

32305
20:25:26,040 --> 20:25:30,640
new mail they can create a new node a

32306
20:25:28,232 --> 20:25:33,960
new rectangle in memory and you the

32307
20:25:30,640 --> 20:25:36,280
human see a new div or a new TR again

32308
20:25:33,960 --> 20:25:38,040
and again and again so with JavaScript

32309
20:25:36,280 --> 20:25:40,360
you just have the ability to control the

32310
20:25:38,040 --> 20:25:42,231
user's experience and instead of like

32311
20:25:40,360 --> 20:25:44,080
I've been doing constantly hitting

32312
20:25:42,232 --> 20:25:45,800
reload in the page to see some new

32313
20:25:44,080 --> 20:25:48,280
content to see some new content

32314
20:25:45,800 --> 20:25:50,192
JavaScript can be running 247 so that

32315
20:25:48,280 --> 20:25:52,920
you can actually see all of these

32316
20:25:50,192 --> 20:25:55,040
changes live all right let's go about

32317
20:25:52,920 --> 20:25:56,720
writing some JavaScript code now instead

32318
20:25:55,040 --> 20:25:58,079
of writing it on the server and

32319
20:25:56,720 --> 20:25:59,832
executing it on the server we're going

32320
20:25:58,080 --> 20:26:02,160
to actually use a very common Paradigm

32321
20:25:59,832 --> 20:26:04,599
whereas JavaScript is actually executed

32322
20:26:02,160 --> 20:26:06,080
in the browser client side that is to

32323
20:26:04,600 --> 20:26:08,872
say we can actually start writing some

32324
20:26:06,080 --> 20:26:11,360
JavaScript code inside of our own HTML

32325
20:26:08,872 --> 20:26:13,280
file so that when a user visits that web

32326
20:26:11,360 --> 20:26:15,640
page with their browser not only is the

32327
20:26:13,280 --> 20:26:17,959
HTML and any CSS downloaded to the

32328
20:26:15,640 --> 20:26:20,319
user's browser so is that JavaScript

32329
20:26:17,960 --> 20:26:23,160
code so that it's executed indeed client

32330
20:26:20,320 --> 20:26:25,480
side on the browser rather than server

32331
20:26:23,160 --> 20:26:27,832
side as has been the case with python in

32332
20:26:25,480 --> 20:26:29,480
previous weeks well where do we go about

32333
20:26:27,832 --> 20:26:32,280
writing some JavaScript code let's go

32334
20:26:29,480 --> 20:26:33,832
ahead and revisit hello.html which

32335
20:26:32,280 --> 20:26:35,440
previously was a completely static

32336
20:26:33,832 --> 20:26:38,000
example that literally just said hello

32337
20:26:35,440 --> 20:26:40,192
title hello body indeed if I open this

32338
20:26:38,000 --> 20:26:42,400
up using HTTP server and view it now in

32339
20:26:40,192 --> 20:26:44,599
a separate tab all it said was exactly

32340
20:26:42,400 --> 20:26:46,760
that hello title in the tab and hello

32341
20:26:44,600 --> 20:26:49,400
body in the main part of the viewport so

32342
20:26:46,760 --> 20:26:50,920
to speak well let's make this example a

32343
20:26:49,400 --> 20:26:53,480
little more Dynamic so it doesn't just

32344
20:26:50,920 --> 20:26:55,720
say hello body but maybe says hello to

32345
20:26:53,480 --> 20:26:57,319
an actual person so let's go ahead and

32346
20:26:55,720 --> 20:27:00,120
do this let's go ahead and remove the

32347
20:26:57,320 --> 20:27:03,160
hardcoded hello body and let's actually

32348
20:27:00,120 --> 20:27:05,040
go ahead here and use a form tag but

32349
20:27:03,160 --> 20:27:07,192
we're not going to use this form in the

32350
20:27:05,040 --> 20:27:08,760
usual way whereby the data gets sent all

32351
20:27:07,192 --> 20:27:10,720
the way back to the server we're going

32352
20:27:08,760 --> 20:27:12,959
to Leverage control over this form

32353
20:27:10,720 --> 20:27:14,872
client side instead so I'm going to go

32354
20:27:12,960 --> 20:27:17,040
ahead and create this open form tag

32355
20:27:14,872 --> 20:27:19,192
close form tag inside of that let me

32356
20:27:17,040 --> 20:27:21,280
give myself a text input that's going to

32357
20:27:19,192 --> 20:27:23,040
have autocomplete equals quote unquote

32358
20:27:21,280 --> 20:27:24,760
off just to ensure that what I

32359
20:27:23,040 --> 20:27:26,832
previously type in my examples doesn't

32360
20:27:24,760 --> 20:27:28,959
reappear accidentally we're going to

32361
20:27:26,832 --> 20:27:30,959
autofocus it so that the cursor is

32362
20:27:28,960 --> 20:27:32,872
blinking right there in that text box

32363
20:27:30,960 --> 20:27:37,000
and this time I'm going to go ahead and

32364
20:27:32,872 --> 20:27:39,480
give it how about a uh placeholder of

32365
20:27:37,000 --> 20:27:41,280
quote unquote name to make clear that

32366
20:27:39,480 --> 20:27:42,959
prompting the user for their name and

32367
20:27:41,280 --> 20:27:45,480
then the type of this text box will be

32368
20:27:42,960 --> 20:27:47,040
the default or more explicitly here text

32369
20:27:45,480 --> 20:27:49,400
and then I'm going to have as we've seen

32370
20:27:47,040 --> 20:27:52,360
before a button the type of which is

32371
20:27:49,400 --> 20:27:53,760
submit also our typical default and then

32372
20:27:52,360 --> 20:27:56,512
inside of this button is going to be the

32373
20:27:53,760 --> 20:27:59,000
label how about something like uh how

32374
20:27:56,512 --> 20:28:00,872
about we'll call this greet so that's

32375
20:27:59,000 --> 20:28:02,920
what the button will actually say well

32376
20:28:00,872 --> 20:28:04,760
let me actually go back into my browser

32377
20:28:02,920 --> 20:28:07,319
tab let me reload this page and we

32378
20:28:04,760 --> 20:28:09,439
should now see a relatively simple form

32379
20:28:07,320 --> 20:28:11,320
whereby I have the cursor blinking on a

32380
20:28:09,440 --> 20:28:12,800
text inp input prompting the user for

32381
20:28:11,320 --> 20:28:14,920
their name and then a greet button that

32382
20:28:12,800 --> 20:28:16,552
I can click but if I click this button

32383
20:28:14,920 --> 20:28:18,040
now it's not going to do anything useful

32384
20:28:16,552 --> 20:28:20,440
because I haven't written any code to

32385
20:28:18,040 --> 20:28:22,040
tell the browser what to do when I click

32386
20:28:20,440 --> 20:28:24,000
that button but it turns out there's all

32387
20:28:22,040 --> 20:28:26,480
sorts of events in the world of

32388
20:28:24,000 --> 20:28:28,120
JavaScript that you can listen for so to

32389
20:28:26,480 --> 20:28:30,400
speak in fact here's just a list of some

32390
20:28:28,120 --> 20:28:32,480
of them anytime something changes in a

32391
20:28:30,400 --> 20:28:35,000
form field anytime the user clicks or

32392
20:28:32,480 --> 20:28:36,552
drags on something anytime the user

32393
20:28:35,000 --> 20:28:38,832
presses a key and maybe lifts their

32394
20:28:36,552 --> 20:28:41,280
finger up anytime the mouse goes down or

32395
20:28:38,832 --> 20:28:44,040
over or up on top of something or

32396
20:28:41,280 --> 20:28:45,480
anytime a form is submitted those are

32397
20:28:44,040 --> 20:28:47,400
events in the same way that we talked

32398
20:28:45,480 --> 20:28:50,319
about events back in week zero in

32399
20:28:47,400 --> 20:28:52,159
scratch and in JavaScript just like in

32400
20:28:50,320 --> 20:28:54,160
scratch where you can do something when

32401
20:28:52,160 --> 20:28:56,480
green flag clicked in JavaScript you can

32402
20:28:54,160 --> 20:28:58,680
write code that actually listens for any

32403
20:28:56,480 --> 20:29:00,959
of these events or more so with that

32404
20:28:58,680 --> 20:29:03,359
said let's go back to vs code here and

32405
20:29:00,960 --> 20:29:05,320
let's make a couple of changes instead

32406
20:29:03,360 --> 20:29:07,000
let's go ahead and add to this form a

32407
20:29:05,320 --> 20:29:08,480
new attribute that's not the best way to

32408
20:29:07,000 --> 20:29:11,480
do it but it's perhaps the simplest for

32409
20:29:08,480 --> 20:29:14,280
version one here and let's say onsubmit

32410
20:29:11,480 --> 20:29:16,959
do the following so onsubmit is an HTML

32411
20:29:14,280 --> 20:29:19,400
attribute and curiously its value inside

32412
20:29:16,960 --> 20:29:21,800
of the quotes there can actually be some

32413
20:29:19,400 --> 20:29:23,552
JavaScript code and let's go ahead now

32414
20:29:21,800 --> 20:29:25,552
and let's assume there exists a function

32415
20:29:23,552 --> 20:29:28,000
in the world called greet and what I

32416
20:29:25,552 --> 20:29:29,959
want to do is call that function right

32417
20:29:28,000 --> 20:29:31,720
then and there well now in JavaScript

32418
20:29:29,960 --> 20:29:33,552
how do I go about making that function

32419
20:29:31,720 --> 20:29:36,080
exist it doesn't come out of the box

32420
20:29:33,552 --> 20:29:38,599
just like print might or say might in

32421
20:29:36,080 --> 20:29:40,440
python or scratch respectively but I can

32422
20:29:38,600 --> 20:29:43,040
do this let me go up into the head of

32423
20:29:40,440 --> 20:29:45,000
this page inside of a script tag here

32424
20:29:43,040 --> 20:29:46,599
both open and close let me actually

32425
20:29:45,000 --> 20:29:47,960
write some JavaScript code and just so

32426
20:29:46,600 --> 20:29:49,232
it stands out I'm going to give myself a

32427
20:29:47,960 --> 20:29:51,512
couple of blank lines though not

32428
20:29:49,232 --> 20:29:54,192
strictly necessary and let me Define a

32429
20:29:51,512 --> 20:29:55,960
new function in JavaScript called greet

32430
20:29:54,192 --> 20:29:57,680
and this is the syntax in JavaScript for

32431
20:29:55,960 --> 20:29:59,512
creating your own function similar in

32432
20:29:57,680 --> 20:30:01,511
Python instead of saying defa in

32433
20:29:59,512 --> 20:30:03,440
JavaScript you just say function then

32434
20:30:01,512 --> 20:30:05,080
the name of the function and any

32435
20:30:03,440 --> 20:30:06,640
arguments within the parentheses

32436
20:30:05,080 --> 20:30:09,160
thereafter but I'm not going to pass in

32437
20:30:06,640 --> 20:30:10,640
any here then inside of curly braces

32438
20:30:09,160 --> 20:30:12,160
what I'm going to do is use a built-in

32439
20:30:10,640 --> 20:30:14,232
JavaScript function that comes with any

32440
20:30:12,160 --> 20:30:16,280
browser called alert it's not the best

32441
20:30:14,232 --> 20:30:18,232
or prettiest user interface but for now

32442
20:30:16,280 --> 20:30:20,160
it's going to get the job done what do I

32443
20:30:18,232 --> 20:30:22,360
want to say to the user well let's first

32444
20:30:20,160 --> 20:30:25,600
just say something simple like hello

32445
20:30:22,360 --> 20:30:28,280
comma World close quote semicolon

32446
20:30:25,600 --> 20:30:30,320
thereby alerting the user with precisely

32447
20:30:28,280 --> 20:30:33,400
that message now what I'm going to do

32448
20:30:30,320 --> 20:30:35,040
down here is make one other change I

32449
20:30:33,400 --> 20:30:37,159
don't want this form to actually get

32450
20:30:35,040 --> 20:30:38,680
submitted to the server just like we've

32451
20:30:37,160 --> 20:30:40,440
seen in the past when you submit a form

32452
20:30:38,680 --> 20:30:43,640
it often goes to something like

32453
20:30:40,440 --> 20:30:46,040
google.com/ search I actually want my

32454
20:30:43,640 --> 20:30:48,480
JavaScript code to take control over the

32455
20:30:46,040 --> 20:30:50,680
entire user experience of this form so

32456
20:30:48,480 --> 20:30:53,552
that I'm just using the form as a user

32457
20:30:50,680 --> 20:30:56,159
input mechanism not to actually send via

32458
20:30:53,552 --> 20:30:58,599
get or post this data to some other

32459
20:30:56,160 --> 20:31:00,600
server including my own so this is going

32460
20:30:58,600 --> 20:31:02,192
to look a little ugly but after calling

32461
20:31:00,600 --> 20:31:03,640
greet I'm actually going to do this

32462
20:31:02,192 --> 20:31:05,832
which I've read the documentation about

32463
20:31:03,640 --> 20:31:07,640
and I know that if you actually hardcode

32464
20:31:05,832 --> 20:31:09,640
return false here that just tells the

32465
20:31:07,640 --> 20:31:12,832
browser please don't actually submit the

32466
20:31:09,640 --> 20:31:14,872
form only call the Greet function all

32467
20:31:12,832 --> 20:31:16,871
right well let me go back to my browser

32468
20:31:14,872 --> 20:31:18,360
here let me reload this because I need

32469
20:31:16,872 --> 20:31:20,160
to download the latest version of the

32470
20:31:18,360 --> 20:31:21,600
JavaScript code and I'm just going to go

32471
20:31:20,160 --> 20:31:23,832
ahead without even typing my name I'm

32472
20:31:21,600 --> 20:31:25,320
going to click on the Greet button and

32473
20:31:23,832 --> 20:31:27,552
you'll see that Al be it a little

32474
20:31:25,320 --> 20:31:29,400
cryptically at the top we see an alert

32475
20:31:27,552 --> 20:31:31,440
that says hello world there's my ugly

32476
20:31:29,400 --> 20:31:33,640
URL of my code space there at the moment

32477
20:31:31,440 --> 20:31:35,192
but we do indeed see that string but

32478
20:31:33,640 --> 20:31:37,400
what I haven't of course done is taken

32479
20:31:35,192 --> 20:31:40,040
any actual name from the user so how can

32480
20:31:37,400 --> 20:31:43,040
we go about doing that well ideally I

32481
20:31:40,040 --> 20:31:44,799
want to alert the user with hello comma

32482
20:31:43,040 --> 20:31:47,159
David or hello comma Carter whatever a

32483
20:31:44,800 --> 20:31:49,080
name I type into that box so how can I

32484
20:31:47,160 --> 20:31:51,160
go about doing that well let me create a

32485
20:31:49,080 --> 20:31:54,120
variable called name and let me set it

32486
20:31:51,160 --> 20:31:57,800
equal to this function call

32487
20:31:54,120 --> 20:32:00,159
document. query

32488
20:31:57,800 --> 20:32:02,080
selector that comes with JavaScript

32489
20:32:00,160 --> 20:32:04,400
itself let me then in parenthesis pass

32490
20:32:02,080 --> 20:32:06,480
in an argument that is going to be huh

32491
20:32:04,400 --> 20:32:09,079
the ID the unique I need a unique

32492
20:32:06,480 --> 20:32:10,552
identifier for the thing I want to

32493
20:32:09,080 --> 20:32:12,600
select so let me actually go back to my

32494
20:32:10,552 --> 20:32:16,080
HTML code here and instead of giving

32495
20:32:12,600 --> 20:32:17,920
this form field a name like Q for query

32496
20:32:16,080 --> 20:32:20,320
let me actually use another HTML

32497
20:32:17,920 --> 20:32:22,360
attribute called ID where now I can call

32498
20:32:20,320 --> 20:32:25,320
this anything I want and for clarity I'm

32499
20:32:22,360 --> 20:32:28,320
just going to call this input element

32500
20:32:25,320 --> 20:32:31,400
uniquely name now up here in query

32501
20:32:28,320 --> 20:32:34,120
selector just like in CSS where you can

32502
20:32:31,400 --> 20:32:36,799
use hashes and dots and other symbology

32503
20:32:34,120 --> 20:32:39,231
in order to select certain nodes in your

32504
20:32:36,800 --> 20:32:41,760
Dom that is rectangles in that memory

32505
20:32:39,232 --> 20:32:43,872
tree well I can go ahead and select hash

32506
20:32:41,760 --> 20:32:46,439
name which again is just the Syntax for

32507
20:32:43,872 --> 20:32:49,000
uniquely selecting the element whose ID

32508
20:32:46,440 --> 20:32:51,360
is in this case name so you have the

32509
20:32:49,000 --> 20:32:53,280
hash up here you don't need the hash as

32510
20:32:51,360 --> 20:32:55,192
the value of the attribute down here on

32511
20:32:53,280 --> 20:32:57,232
line 20 and now if I want to actually

32512
20:32:55,192 --> 20:32:59,512
get the value of that text box I

32513
20:32:57,232 --> 20:33:01,232
literally just say do value so document

32514
20:32:59,512 --> 20:33:02,920
refers to the whole web page itself

32515
20:33:01,232 --> 20:33:05,232
query selector is a function that's

32516
20:33:02,920 --> 20:33:08,040
built into that object so to speak and

32517
20:33:05,232 --> 20:33:10,832
the value accessible via value just like

32518
20:33:08,040 --> 20:33:12,832
a c stru or even a python class allows

32519
20:33:10,832 --> 20:33:15,040
me to go inside of that text field and

32520
20:33:12,832 --> 20:33:18,159
get whatever the value the user has

32521
20:33:15,040 --> 20:33:21,000
typed in now as I've uh been able to do

32522
20:33:18,160 --> 20:33:23,280
in languages like python pretty Le

32523
20:33:21,000 --> 20:33:27,000
fairly readily I can concatenate this

32524
20:33:23,280 --> 20:33:28,872
name onto the string hello comma space

32525
20:33:27,000 --> 20:33:30,400
so as to form a complete phrase and

32526
20:33:28,872 --> 20:33:32,440
you'll notice here that I'm actually

32527
20:33:30,400 --> 20:33:34,599
using single quotes in my JavaScript

32528
20:33:32,440 --> 20:33:37,120
double quotes in my HTML this is perhaps

32529
20:33:34,600 --> 20:33:39,040
a common convention in JavaScript the

32530
20:33:37,120 --> 20:33:40,552
language does not care if you use double

32531
20:33:39,040 --> 20:33:42,360
quotes or single quotes but I dare say

32532
20:33:40,552 --> 20:33:44,512
single quotes are just more common and

32533
20:33:42,360 --> 20:33:45,872
so that's what I've done here all right

32534
20:33:44,512 --> 20:33:47,512
now as always I'm going to cross my

32535
20:33:45,872 --> 20:33:49,360
fingers go back to this page I'm going

32536
20:33:47,512 --> 20:33:50,832
to reload because I've changed the

32537
20:33:49,360 --> 20:33:52,800
JavaScript and I need my browser to

32538
20:33:50,832 --> 20:33:56,192
download it and now I'm going to type in

32539
20:33:52,800 --> 20:33:59,720
my name for instance David click greets

32540
20:33:56,192 --> 20:34:02,599
with fingers crossed and voila now I see

32541
20:33:59,720 --> 20:34:04,552
hello comma David all right so it turns

32542
20:34:02,600 --> 20:34:08,080
out that while functional this isn't the

32543
20:34:04,552 --> 20:34:09,760
best design and co-mingling your uh HTML

32544
20:34:08,080 --> 20:34:11,920
with your JavaScript script code AS with

32545
20:34:09,760 --> 20:34:13,959
this onsubmit attribute isn't

32546
20:34:11,920 --> 20:34:17,160
particularly clean it's better as with

32547
20:34:13,960 --> 20:34:19,480
CSS to keep your HTML over here your CSS

32548
20:34:17,160 --> 20:34:21,000
over here and your JavaScript now over

32549
20:34:19,480 --> 20:34:23,231
here so to speak and better still

32550
20:34:21,000 --> 20:34:24,680
perhaps even in some separate files so

32551
20:34:23,232 --> 20:34:26,680
how can I go about changing this a

32552
20:34:24,680 --> 20:34:29,040
little bit well let me go ahead and

32553
20:34:26,680 --> 20:34:31,359
actually let's go ahead and delete all

32554
20:34:29,040 --> 20:34:33,871
of this code for just a moment and let

32555
20:34:31,360 --> 20:34:35,680
me go and get rid of this on submit

32556
20:34:33,872 --> 20:34:39,000
Handler down here and really just

32557
20:34:35,680 --> 20:34:41,192
distill my HTML only into the HTML and

32558
20:34:39,000 --> 20:34:44,400
the attributes therefore and what I'm

32559
20:34:41,192 --> 20:34:47,640
instead going to do now is do this I can

32560
20:34:44,400 --> 20:34:50,959
use JavaScript to achieve the listening

32561
20:34:47,640 --> 20:34:53,360
for that submit event or that onsubmit

32562
20:34:50,960 --> 20:34:56,000
event I don't need to actually use HTML

32563
20:34:53,360 --> 20:34:58,680
for that I can use JavaScript entirely

32564
20:34:56,000 --> 20:35:00,600
so it turns out I can access some other

32565
20:34:58,680 --> 20:35:03,871
uh member of this document by doing

32566
20:35:00,600 --> 20:35:06,440
document. query selector again but this

32567
20:35:03,872 --> 20:35:08,440
time let's select the actual form tag

32568
20:35:06,440 --> 20:35:11,192
and it doesn't have an ID because it has

32569
20:35:08,440 --> 20:35:12,832
no ID in its HTML but it does have a tag

32570
20:35:11,192 --> 20:35:15,319
name so just like in CSS when you can

32571
20:35:12,832 --> 20:35:17,231
Target Elements by way of their name I'm

32572
20:35:15,320 --> 20:35:19,120
just going to select the one and only

32573
20:35:17,232 --> 20:35:21,040
form on this page by using that same

32574
20:35:19,120 --> 20:35:22,640
query selector function and now I'm

32575
20:35:21,040 --> 20:35:24,360
going to use another function that just

32576
20:35:22,640 --> 20:35:26,720
comes with JavaScript in the context of

32577
20:35:24,360 --> 20:35:30,040
browsers whereby once you select an

32578
20:35:26,720 --> 20:35:32,360
element like that form I can call add

32579
20:35:30,040 --> 20:35:34,360
event listener which is similar in

32580
20:35:32,360 --> 20:35:36,832
spirit to scratches when green flag

32581
20:35:34,360 --> 20:35:38,232
clicked or any block like that you can

32582
20:35:36,832 --> 20:35:40,040
then tell the browser what event you

32583
20:35:38,232 --> 20:35:41,800
want to listen for I want to listen for

32584
20:35:40,040 --> 20:35:43,480
the submit event so you don't say

32585
20:35:41,800 --> 20:35:46,000
onsubmit here now that we're in pure

32586
20:35:43,480 --> 20:35:48,480
JavaScript you just say submit and now I

32587
20:35:46,000 --> 20:35:50,760
can do something like this I can go

32588
20:35:48,480 --> 20:35:52,040
ahead and say call the following

32589
20:35:50,760 --> 20:35:53,511
function and I'm not even going to

32590
20:35:52,040 --> 20:35:55,319
bother giving this function a name and

32591
20:35:53,512 --> 20:35:57,440
that is allowed to in JavaScript as we

32592
20:35:55,320 --> 20:36:00,832
saw briefly in Python and what I'm going

32593
20:35:57,440 --> 20:36:02,800
to do now inside of curly braces after

32594
20:36:00,832 --> 20:36:04,832
that keyword function is the same kind

32595
20:36:02,800 --> 20:36:08,920
of code as before I'm going to do let

32596
20:36:04,832 --> 20:36:11,720
name equals document. query selector I'm

32597
20:36:08,920 --> 20:36:14,760
going to select that same IDE uh same

32598
20:36:11,720 --> 20:36:16,960
Name ID as before and get its value and

32599
20:36:14,760 --> 20:36:19,439
then I'm going to do alert and then pass

32600
20:36:16,960 --> 20:36:21,400
in hello comma a single quote again

32601
20:36:19,440 --> 20:36:25,120
after that concatenate with that the

32602
20:36:21,400 --> 20:36:26,920
name and then semicolon but I need to do

32603
20:36:25,120 --> 20:36:28,192
one other thing it turns out that this

32604
20:36:26,920 --> 20:36:30,080
function and if you read the

32605
20:36:28,192 --> 20:36:32,760
documentation for this technique

32606
20:36:30,080 --> 20:36:34,920
actually takes automatically a special

32607
20:36:32,760 --> 20:36:37,000
argument called by convention event and

32608
20:36:34,920 --> 20:36:39,120
this is just an a variable if you will

32609
20:36:37,000 --> 20:36:40,360
that refers to whatever event just

32610
20:36:39,120 --> 20:36:42,360
happened in this case it's of course

32611
20:36:40,360 --> 20:36:44,080
going to be submit but in other contexts

32612
20:36:42,360 --> 20:36:46,360
it might be a click event a mouse down

32613
20:36:44,080 --> 20:36:48,000
event or something else entirely so this

32614
20:36:46,360 --> 20:36:49,552
allows me now to do this which is a

32615
20:36:48,000 --> 20:36:51,720
little cryptic but you get used to these

32616
20:36:49,552 --> 20:36:54,040
conventions I can use that event

32617
20:36:51,720 --> 20:36:56,000
whatever it is and then prevent whatever

32618
20:36:54,040 --> 20:36:58,040
the default behavior is by calling a

32619
20:36:56,000 --> 20:37:00,320
special function called prevent default

32620
20:36:58,040 --> 20:37:03,360
with a capital D this is the alternative

32621
20:37:00,320 --> 20:37:06,512
to that Messier return fall semicolon

32622
20:37:03,360 --> 20:37:08,600
that I had inside of my HTML before so

32623
20:37:06,512 --> 20:37:11,680
all I've done here now is I've left all

32624
20:37:08,600 --> 20:37:13,640
of my HTML as pure HTML down here and

32625
20:37:11,680 --> 20:37:15,599
I've put all of my JavaScript code as

32626
20:37:13,640 --> 20:37:17,232
pure JavaScript up here this sort of

32627
20:37:15,600 --> 20:37:19,640
separation of concerns similar to what

32628
20:37:17,232 --> 20:37:21,320
we started doing with CSS just a bit ago

32629
20:37:19,640 --> 20:37:23,360
in order to keep those two languages

32630
20:37:21,320 --> 20:37:26,160
separate too well let me go back to my

32631
20:37:23,360 --> 20:37:27,832
browser here reload the page and

32632
20:37:26,160 --> 20:37:29,320
unfortunately there's a subtle mistake

32633
20:37:27,832 --> 20:37:32,159
I've made here let me go ahead and type

32634
20:37:29,320 --> 20:37:34,440
in David and click greet and

32635
20:37:32,160 --> 20:37:36,080
unfortunately nothing actually seems to

32636
20:37:34,440 --> 20:37:39,120
happen well maybe it's just my name

32637
20:37:36,080 --> 20:37:41,360
Carter greet and nothing seems to happen

32638
20:37:39,120 --> 20:37:44,360
that alert does not come up well why is

32639
20:37:41,360 --> 20:37:46,040
that well let me go back to vs code here

32640
20:37:44,360 --> 20:37:48,280
and point out that order of operations

32641
20:37:46,040 --> 20:37:51,680
in zscript matters similar in spirit to

32642
20:37:48,280 --> 20:37:53,720
C because on line seven I'm selecting

32643
20:37:51,680 --> 20:37:55,832
the form and trying to add an event

32644
20:37:53,720 --> 20:37:57,920
listener for submitting that form

32645
20:37:55,832 --> 20:37:59,871
unfortunately the form had better exist

32646
20:37:57,920 --> 20:38:02,040
at that moment in time but it doesn't

32647
20:37:59,872 --> 20:38:03,920
because just like in C and in some cases

32648
20:38:02,040 --> 20:38:05,959
python where the compiler or The

32649
20:38:03,920 --> 20:38:07,832
Interpreter reads the code top to bottom

32650
20:38:05,960 --> 20:38:09,552
notice that the form doesn't actually

32651
20:38:07,832 --> 20:38:12,439
exist and therefore get loaded into the

32652
20:38:09,552 --> 20:38:14,720
computer's memory until line 19 so we've

32653
20:38:12,440 --> 20:38:17,120
got to kind of reorder these somehow now

32654
20:38:14,720 --> 20:38:19,512
maybe the simplest way to do this would

32655
20:38:17,120 --> 20:38:21,680
just be to perhaps do something like

32656
20:38:19,512 --> 20:38:24,760
this let me scroll back up to my script

32657
20:38:21,680 --> 20:38:27,319
tag and perhaps a little more explicitly

32658
20:38:24,760 --> 20:38:28,871
move it into the order in which I want

32659
20:38:27,320 --> 20:38:31,120
it to be executed so I'm going to go

32660
20:38:28,872 --> 20:38:32,920
below my form and inside of my body

32661
20:38:31,120 --> 20:38:35,120
which is actually okay for JavaScript

32662
20:38:32,920 --> 20:38:36,832
here and just use that same code and

32663
20:38:35,120 --> 20:38:38,832
assuming I didn't make any typos let's

32664
20:38:36,832 --> 20:38:41,040
go back to the browser click reload

32665
20:38:38,832 --> 20:38:42,832
again to get the latest typee in my name

32666
20:38:41,040 --> 20:38:44,192
again using that purely JavaScript

32667
20:38:42,832 --> 20:38:46,280
solution and the only change I made was

32668
20:38:44,192 --> 20:38:49,440
I move the code from up here to down

32669
20:38:46,280 --> 20:38:52,000
here clicking greet now and wow it's now

32670
20:38:49,440 --> 20:38:53,760
back we get the alert with hello comma

32671
20:38:52,000 --> 20:38:55,440
David so those kinds of things those

32672
20:38:53,760 --> 20:38:56,871
kinds of principles matter at least when

32673
20:38:55,440 --> 20:38:58,440
we're back in this world but there's

32674
20:38:56,872 --> 20:39:00,000
other Solutions too and just so that

32675
20:38:58,440 --> 20:39:02,120
you've seen it because it's a common

32676
20:39:00,000 --> 20:39:05,040
convention in libraries as well let me

32677
20:39:02,120 --> 20:39:07,159
undo that change and put that script tag

32678
20:39:05,040 --> 20:39:08,832
back in the head or really anywhere else

32679
20:39:07,160 --> 20:39:10,360
in the page where it might be

32680
20:39:08,832 --> 20:39:12,599
and let me propose that there's one

32681
20:39:10,360 --> 20:39:15,680
other way to solve this problem to

32682
20:39:12,600 --> 20:39:17,512
postpone that code on line 7 through 11

32683
20:39:15,680 --> 20:39:20,640
getting executed until really the whole

32684
20:39:17,512 --> 20:39:23,080
Dom the tree is ready to go and the

32685
20:39:20,640 --> 20:39:25,640
Syntax for this might be as follows I

32686
20:39:23,080 --> 20:39:28,232
can do document and I can add to the

32687
20:39:25,640 --> 20:39:29,720
document a an event listener that's

32688
20:39:28,232 --> 20:39:30,960
going to listen for something a little

32689
20:39:29,720 --> 20:39:32,400
special and I always have to look this

32690
20:39:30,960 --> 20:39:34,232
up myself to remember the spelling and

32691
20:39:32,400 --> 20:39:35,832
the capitalization but it turns out that

32692
20:39:34,232 --> 20:39:37,920
the browser itself once it's done

32693
20:39:35,832 --> 20:39:41,360
loading all of your HTML top to bottom

32694
20:39:37,920 --> 20:39:45,160
left right it will raise an event called

32695
20:39:41,360 --> 20:39:47,160
Dom content loaded capitalized exactly

32696
20:39:45,160 --> 20:39:49,000
as such and if you want to call some

32697
20:39:47,160 --> 20:39:51,400
function and I don't even need an event

32698
20:39:49,000 --> 20:39:54,040
argument in this case you can open curly

32699
20:39:51,400 --> 20:39:55,760
braces just as before and put inside of

32700
20:39:54,040 --> 20:39:58,192
those curly braces the code that you

32701
20:39:55,760 --> 20:40:00,599
want to execute only once the dumbs

32702
20:39:58,192 --> 20:40:02,080
content has been loaded top to bottom

32703
20:40:00,600 --> 20:40:03,640
and now let me just finish my thought

32704
20:40:02,080 --> 20:40:05,832
with a closed curly brace Clos

32705
20:40:03,640 --> 20:40:07,440
parenthesis and semicolon it gets a

32706
20:40:05,832 --> 20:40:09,400
little Annoying to visually line all of

32707
20:40:07,440 --> 20:40:11,960
this up but I think I'm still good and

32708
20:40:09,400 --> 20:40:15,079
now even though this code is at the top

32709
20:40:11,960 --> 20:40:17,720
of my file or really above the form tag

32710
20:40:15,080 --> 20:40:20,080
itself I think we're okay so let's go

32711
20:40:17,720 --> 20:40:22,832
back to the browser here reload the page

32712
20:40:20,080 --> 20:40:25,040
type in David and click greet and we

32713
20:40:22,832 --> 20:40:26,799
still get the same correct behavior and

32714
20:40:25,040 --> 20:40:29,192
so this is just a very common Paradigm

32715
20:40:26,800 --> 20:40:30,800
to use these kinds of events to listen

32716
20:40:29,192 --> 20:40:33,400
and listen and listen for something to

32717
20:40:30,800 --> 20:40:35,920
happen and then only do something once

32718
20:40:33,400 --> 20:40:37,640
that thing has transpired all right well

32719
20:40:35,920 --> 20:40:39,040
let's take one more step with JavaScript

32720
20:40:37,640 --> 20:40:40,640
code before we take a look at what's

32721
20:40:39,040 --> 20:40:43,000
really fun about this language and what

32722
20:40:40,640 --> 20:40:44,800
you can do with browsers in particular

32723
20:40:43,000 --> 20:40:46,192
by just cleaning things up a little bit

32724
20:40:44,800 --> 20:40:48,160
further I'm going to go back into the

32725
20:40:46,192 --> 20:40:51,440
code here and I'm actually going to

32726
20:40:48,160 --> 20:40:54,552
remove uh or cut all of this code out of

32727
20:40:51,440 --> 20:40:56,640
the hello.html file itself and I'm going

32728
20:40:54,552 --> 20:40:59,192
to change my script tag to have nothing

32729
20:40:56,640 --> 20:41:01,232
in between the open and close tag but I

32730
20:40:59,192 --> 20:41:02,760
am going to give it a source attribute

32731
20:41:01,232 --> 20:41:05,832
and let's go ahead and call this for

32732
20:41:02,760 --> 20:41:07,480
instance hello.js sojs would be the

32733
20:41:05,832 --> 20:41:09,231
convention for the file extension for a

32734
20:41:07,480 --> 20:41:11,040
Javascript file and even though this is

32735
20:41:09,232 --> 20:41:13,440
a little weird that we have the script

32736
20:41:11,040 --> 20:41:15,439
tag and a source attribute then nothing

32737
20:41:13,440 --> 20:41:16,872
in between the open and close tag this

32738
20:41:15,440 --> 20:41:19,120
is indeed the convention when you want

32739
20:41:16,872 --> 20:41:20,920
to put all of your code in a separate

32740
20:41:19,120 --> 20:41:23,040
file and let me go ahead and do that let

32741
20:41:20,920 --> 20:41:25,360
me go ahead and open my terminal window

32742
20:41:23,040 --> 20:41:27,920
create a new file called

32743
20:41:25,360 --> 20:41:29,720
hello.js and then in that file I'm just

32744
20:41:27,920 --> 20:41:32,192
going to paste the very code that I just

32745
20:41:29,720 --> 20:41:34,040
cut from the previous file so no changes

32746
20:41:32,192 --> 20:41:35,680
to the code all I'm doing is factoring

32747
20:41:34,040 --> 20:41:38,319
it out and now I'm doing something just

32748
20:41:35,680 --> 20:41:40,192
like our CSS factorization before which

32749
20:41:38,320 --> 20:41:42,360
confusingly use the link tag this uses

32750
20:41:40,192 --> 20:41:43,959
the script tag this just now allows me

32751
20:41:42,360 --> 20:41:45,512
to collaborate with someone like Carter

32752
20:41:43,960 --> 20:41:47,480
or someone else so that they can do the

32753
20:41:45,512 --> 20:41:49,680
JavaScript code I can do the HTML maybe

32754
20:41:47,480 --> 20:41:52,192
a third person can do the CSS and indeed

32755
20:41:49,680 --> 20:41:55,871
maybe we can build even grander things

32756
20:41:52,192 --> 20:41:57,799
by uh designing things in this way all

32757
20:41:55,872 --> 20:42:00,552
right well let me go back to my browser

32758
20:41:57,800 --> 20:42:02,440
again reload the page I shouldn't see

32759
20:42:00,552 --> 20:42:05,231
any visual changes but if I type in my

32760
20:42:02,440 --> 20:42:07,640
name again David and click greet this

32761
20:42:05,232 --> 20:42:09,120
still now works and what my browser has

32762
20:42:07,640 --> 20:42:12,920
just done underneath the hood is not

32763
20:42:09,120 --> 20:42:15,192
only download the uh hello.html file as

32764
20:42:12,920 --> 20:42:16,800
always because there's now this script

32765
20:42:15,192 --> 20:42:18,280
tag that's referencing the source of

32766
20:42:16,800 --> 20:42:20,360
another file just like an image tag

32767
20:42:18,280 --> 20:42:22,400
might reference the source of an image

32768
20:42:20,360 --> 20:42:25,680
the browser is automatically helping me

32769
20:42:22,400 --> 20:42:29,040
out by loading that into its memory as

32770
20:42:25,680 --> 20:42:30,120
well and now how about one final example

32771
20:42:29,040 --> 20:42:32,231
and for this one I'm going to go ahead

32772
20:42:30,120 --> 20:42:33,799
and not write it live but open it up as

32773
20:42:32,232 --> 20:42:36,040
prepared in advance just to show you

32774
20:42:33,800 --> 20:42:38,192
what you can do by listening for some of

32775
20:42:36,040 --> 20:42:39,832
these other events as well like the key

32776
20:42:38,192 --> 20:42:41,440
up the finger going down the finger

32777
20:42:39,832 --> 20:42:43,280
going up and listening for exactly that

32778
20:42:41,440 --> 20:42:45,512
so as the user is typing something you

32779
20:42:43,280 --> 20:42:47,040
can do something interesting as well I'm

32780
20:42:45,512 --> 20:42:49,232
going to go back into my directory

32781
20:42:47,040 --> 20:42:50,760
listing here and I click on this Source

32782
20:42:49,232 --> 20:42:52,640
a directory which has all of the

32783
20:42:50,760 --> 20:42:54,360
examples that I wrote here in advance

32784
20:42:52,640 --> 20:42:58,400
and I'm going to scroll down to one

32785
20:42:54,360 --> 20:43:00,040
called hello 5. HTML and in hello 5 now

32786
20:42:58,400 --> 20:43:02,640
we've gotten rid of the button and we

32787
20:43:00,040 --> 20:43:04,480
just have this text box but notice now

32788
20:43:02,640 --> 20:43:09,640
what happens if I start typing my name

32789
20:43:04,480 --> 20:43:11,231
as d a v i d D I'm not typing enter at

32790
20:43:09,640 --> 20:43:12,800
all and in fact if I start deleting and

32791
20:43:11,232 --> 20:43:15,040
I change my mind and start typing

32792
20:43:12,800 --> 20:43:17,040
Carter's name notice now that the web

32793
20:43:15,040 --> 20:43:19,599
page the Dom inside of the computer's

32794
20:43:17,040 --> 20:43:21,079
memory is now automatically updating

32795
20:43:19,600 --> 20:43:23,640
itself so it's not even listening it

32796
20:43:21,080 --> 20:43:26,960
would seem for a submit event anymore

32797
20:43:23,640 --> 20:43:29,360
but maybe for a key up event instead so

32798
20:43:26,960 --> 20:43:31,280
let me go back to VSS code here open my

32799
20:43:29,360 --> 20:43:35,680
terminal window and in my source a

32800
20:43:31,280 --> 20:43:37,440
directory let me open up hello 5. HTML

32801
20:43:35,680 --> 20:43:39,511
inside of the script tag you'll see some

32802
20:43:37,440 --> 20:43:41,160
code that's similar in spirit to before

32803
20:43:39,512 --> 20:43:43,280
whereby I'm adding an event listener to

32804
20:43:41,160 --> 20:43:45,960
the document waiting for the whole Dom's

32805
20:43:43,280 --> 20:43:49,360
content to be loaded but then inside of

32806
20:43:45,960 --> 20:43:51,192
that function I'm now doing this I'm

32807
20:43:49,360 --> 20:43:53,280
creating a variable called input and

32808
20:43:51,192 --> 20:43:55,319
selecting from the document the one and

32809
20:43:53,280 --> 20:43:58,600
only input tag that we saw just a moment

32810
20:43:55,320 --> 20:44:01,000
ago I'm then adding on line 11 in event

32811
20:43:58,600 --> 20:44:03,080
listener for key up which is exactly

32812
20:44:01,000 --> 20:44:04,832
that gesture so that I can execute some

32813
20:44:03,080 --> 20:44:06,280
additional code anytime the human lists

32814
20:44:04,832 --> 20:44:08,959
their finger from the keyboard after

32815
20:44:06,280 --> 20:44:10,552
typing a key what do I then do well I'm

32816
20:44:08,960 --> 20:44:12,480
going to go ahead it seems and declare

32817
20:44:10,552 --> 20:44:14,440
another variable called name and I'm

32818
20:44:12,480 --> 20:44:16,400
just going to select some P tag on the

32819
20:44:14,440 --> 20:44:17,720
page and now we didn't really see a P

32820
20:44:16,400 --> 20:44:20,159
tag so I think it's time to look at the

32821
20:44:17,720 --> 20:44:22,720
HTML if I scroll down to the bottom of

32822
20:44:20,160 --> 20:44:24,920
the page where my actual HTML is you'll

32823
20:44:22,720 --> 20:44:26,872
see that there's just a form tag and no

32824
20:44:24,920 --> 20:44:29,400
onsubmit Handler anymore as before

32825
20:44:26,872 --> 20:44:32,280
there's just an input tag and no button

32826
20:44:29,400 --> 20:44:34,192
at all but there is on line 29 here an

32827
20:44:32,280 --> 20:44:35,800
open and close P tag just so I have an

32828
20:44:34,192 --> 20:44:38,040
empty placeholder in which to put

32829
20:44:35,800 --> 20:44:41,040
something like hello David or hello

32830
20:44:38,040 --> 20:44:42,719
Carter so that's why now on line 12 I

32831
20:44:41,040 --> 20:44:45,719
can define a variable called name and I

32832
20:44:42,720 --> 20:44:48,720
can select that P tag so that what do I

32833
20:44:45,720 --> 20:44:50,640
want to do well if inside of the input

32834
20:44:48,720 --> 20:44:52,920
there's a value so this is essentially

32835
20:44:50,640 --> 20:44:56,232
checking for null or the absence of a

32836
20:44:52,920 --> 20:44:58,440
string so if input. value does not equal

32837
20:44:56,232 --> 20:45:00,720
nothing that is there is a value in that

32838
20:44:58,440 --> 20:45:02,960
text box well this syntax here on line

32839
20:45:00,720 --> 20:45:06,480
14 is a very clever way of doing the

32840
20:45:02,960 --> 20:45:09,160
following go into that name tag that is

32841
20:45:06,480 --> 20:45:11,832
to say the empty par paragraph change

32842
20:45:09,160 --> 20:45:15,400
the inner HTML of it the HTML inside of

32843
20:45:11,832 --> 20:45:17,040
it to be literally this hello comma and

32844
20:45:15,400 --> 20:45:18,871
then just so you've seen an additional

32845
20:45:17,040 --> 20:45:20,920
piece of syntax this is similar to

32846
20:45:18,872 --> 20:45:22,440
Python's F strings the syntax is a

32847
20:45:20,920 --> 20:45:24,280
little weird in JavaScript you actually

32848
20:45:22,440 --> 20:45:26,512
use not single quotes not double quotes

32849
20:45:24,280 --> 20:45:28,040
but back ticks which on a US English

32850
20:45:26,512 --> 20:45:30,600
keyboard are typically the top leftand

32851
20:45:28,040 --> 20:45:33,439
key of your keyboard or thereabouts and

32852
20:45:30,600 --> 20:45:36,552
using dollar sign curly braces just like

32853
20:45:33,440 --> 20:45:38,480
the curly braces alone in Python allows

32854
20:45:36,552 --> 20:45:41,040
us to plug in whatever the value is of

32855
20:45:38,480 --> 20:45:42,512
that input however if there's no value

32856
20:45:41,040 --> 20:45:45,079
there it looks like I'm just going to

32857
20:45:42,512 --> 20:45:47,120
say hello whoever you are and in fact we

32858
20:45:45,080 --> 20:45:49,320
can see that behavior now is I delete

32859
20:45:47,120 --> 20:45:51,959
delete delete delete delete delete and

32860
20:45:49,320 --> 20:45:53,960
nothing's there now that if condition is

32861
20:45:51,960 --> 20:45:56,192
no longer true and so we see this

32862
20:45:53,960 --> 20:45:58,680
default value instead so this is only to

32863
20:45:56,192 --> 20:46:00,319
say that by harnessing these various

32864
20:45:58,680 --> 20:46:02,552
events that are constantly happening on

32865
20:46:00,320 --> 20:46:04,280
most any web page we can now register

32866
20:46:02,552 --> 20:46:06,231
code just like we did way back in

32867
20:46:04,280 --> 20:46:09,400
scratch to actually listen for those

32868
20:46:06,232 --> 20:46:11,320
events and do something with them now it

32869
20:46:09,400 --> 20:46:13,192
turns out we can do some interesting

32870
20:46:11,320 --> 20:46:14,872
things even using third party coat and

32871
20:46:13,192 --> 20:46:17,159
just as we used bootstrap a bit ago to

32872
20:46:14,872 --> 20:46:19,920
make our table prettier allow me to

32873
20:46:17,160 --> 20:46:21,920
propose that we also take a look at this

32874
20:46:19,920 --> 20:46:24,160
version of favorites as well let me go

32875
20:46:21,920 --> 20:46:26,192
back into my source a directory and open

32876
20:46:24,160 --> 20:46:27,720
up favorites 2 which I made in advance

32877
20:46:26,192 --> 20:46:29,832
which looks almost the same though I've

32878
20:46:27,720 --> 20:46:34,280
zoomed in here a bit but you'll notice

32879
20:46:29,832 --> 20:46:37,080
somewhat subtly over the leftmost column

32880
20:46:34,280 --> 20:46:39,192
in this table you'll see now this arrow

32881
20:46:37,080 --> 20:46:40,872
in Gray pointing up and pointing down

32882
20:46:39,192 --> 20:46:43,280
previously those were not there all I

32883
20:46:40,872 --> 20:46:45,192
had was a static HTML table with all of

32884
20:46:43,280 --> 20:46:47,832
this data sorted in whatever order it

32885
20:46:45,192 --> 20:46:50,080
was inputed the other day in that form

32886
20:46:47,832 --> 20:46:53,159
but now notice what I can do if I want

32887
20:46:50,080 --> 20:46:55,040
to sort in uh one order I can click this

32888
20:46:53,160 --> 20:46:56,480
Arrow or the other order I can sort in

32889
20:46:55,040 --> 20:46:59,079
this Arrow so essentially doing it

32890
20:46:56,480 --> 20:47:00,552
chronologically forward or backward now

32891
20:46:59,080 --> 20:47:02,120
how is that sorting happening it's

32892
20:47:00,552 --> 20:47:04,360
presumably based on all of the

32893
20:47:02,120 --> 20:47:06,192
timestamps that were registered when we

32894
20:47:04,360 --> 20:47:10,440
submitted that Google form just a bit

32895
20:47:06,192 --> 20:47:12,040
ago um uh when it was live but now using

32896
20:47:10,440 --> 20:47:14,552
JavaScript it turns out that we can use

32897
20:47:12,040 --> 20:47:15,920
some logic somehow and sort this data by

32898
20:47:14,552 --> 20:47:18,512
the same and you don't get that

32899
20:47:15,920 --> 20:47:20,319
automatically just by using HTML alone

32900
20:47:18,512 --> 20:47:22,400
now how did I achieve that well it turns

32901
20:47:20,320 --> 20:47:25,640
out if I go ahead and close these hello

32902
20:47:22,400 --> 20:47:28,799
files and in vs code let's open up uh

32903
20:47:25,640 --> 20:47:30,800
favorites 2. HTML you'll see that all of

32904
20:47:28,800 --> 20:47:32,760
the HTML is actually the same if I

32905
20:47:30,800 --> 20:47:34,280
scroll down and down through this file

32906
20:47:32,760 --> 20:47:36,799
but I added a little something

32907
20:47:34,280 --> 20:47:39,120
interesting at top I copied and pasted

32908
20:47:36,800 --> 20:47:41,832
the appropriate URLs and HTML tags from

32909
20:47:39,120 --> 20:47:43,920
bootstraps documentation and you'll see

32910
20:47:41,832 --> 20:47:46,832
here that I have a file called not only

32911
20:47:43,920 --> 20:47:49,280
bootstrap.css but also

32912
20:47:46,832 --> 20:47:51,400
bootstrap.min.js as well as a couple of

32913
20:47:49,280 --> 20:47:54,232
other things as well that allows me

32914
20:47:51,400 --> 20:47:56,920
ultimately using third-party libraries

32915
20:47:54,232 --> 20:47:59,552
to add some special HTML attributes that

32916
20:47:56,920 --> 20:48:01,160
those libraries told me to add and then

32917
20:47:59,552 --> 20:48:02,920
as soon as those libraries detect the

32918
20:48:01,160 --> 20:48:05,440
presence of these attributes now on my

32919
20:48:02,920 --> 20:48:07,832
own raw data they do their thing and

32920
20:48:05,440 --> 20:48:10,192
javascrip defy not a technical term the

32921
20:48:07,832 --> 20:48:12,400
entire table and now make it interactive

32922
20:48:10,192 --> 20:48:14,000
and not static so you'll see here that

32923
20:48:12,400 --> 20:48:16,192
the Aesthetics of the table are as

32924
20:48:14,000 --> 20:48:18,400
before table and table striped but I'm

32925
20:48:16,192 --> 20:48:20,920
adding now another HTML attribute called

32926
20:48:18,400 --> 20:48:22,760
Data toggle whose value is table and I

32927
20:48:20,920 --> 20:48:24,599
know that only from the documentation of

32928
20:48:22,760 --> 20:48:27,040
these libraries indicating that's that's

32929
20:48:24,600 --> 20:48:29,640
how I can now enable this table to be

32930
20:48:27,040 --> 20:48:32,400
interactive as I can too by adding data

32931
20:48:29,640 --> 20:48:34,800
sortable equals quote unquote true on

32932
20:48:32,400 --> 20:48:36,439
specifically the timestamp column and

32933
20:48:34,800 --> 20:48:39,160
the only thing unfamiliar here perhaps

32934
20:48:36,440 --> 20:48:41,872
is I'm using t P for table heading as

32935
20:48:39,160 --> 20:48:43,920
opposed to TD as I do elsewhere but

32936
20:48:41,872 --> 20:48:45,512
that's all that it takes to now focus on

32937
20:48:43,920 --> 20:48:47,480
the raw data you want to present and let

32938
20:48:45,512 --> 20:48:49,832
someone else do the heavy lifting of

32939
20:48:47,480 --> 20:48:52,552
actually implementing the logic well

32940
20:48:49,832 --> 20:48:54,640
let's end with just a look at what more

32941
20:48:52,552 --> 20:48:56,319
you can do with Java script and just how

32942
20:48:54,640 --> 20:48:59,000
powerful it is when you combine a

32943
20:48:56,320 --> 20:49:01,232
language like this with the data and the

32944
20:48:59,000 --> 20:49:03,512
uh user interface you want to convey

32945
20:49:01,232 --> 20:49:05,640
let's go ahead and open up within Source

32946
20:49:03,512 --> 20:49:08,080
a directory something called background.

32947
20:49:05,640 --> 20:49:10,360
HTML now this interface here is quite

32948
20:49:08,080 --> 20:49:12,232
simple it just has three buttons RG and

32949
20:49:10,360 --> 20:49:14,120
B and the background of course noticed

32950
20:49:12,232 --> 20:49:16,480
by default is just white but when I

32951
20:49:14,120 --> 20:49:18,192
click on the r the background turns red

32952
20:49:16,480 --> 20:49:20,440
when the I click on the G it turns green

32953
20:49:18,192 --> 20:49:23,120
and the blue it turns blue and again and

32954
20:49:20,440 --> 20:49:25,120
again so how is this working well if you

32955
20:49:23,120 --> 20:49:27,120
think back again to the available events

32956
20:49:25,120 --> 20:49:29,599
perhaps I'm just listening for a click

32957
20:49:27,120 --> 20:49:31,512
on those buttons and then doing

32958
20:49:29,600 --> 20:49:33,552
something with maybe the CSS of the page

32959
20:49:31,512 --> 20:49:35,640
to allow me to see those different

32960
20:49:33,552 --> 20:49:38,480
colors so in fact let's go back to vs

32961
20:49:35,640 --> 20:49:41,480
code here and let's open up background.

32962
20:49:38,480 --> 20:49:43,640
HTML and in here you'll see some simple

32963
20:49:41,480 --> 20:49:46,231
HTML at the top just three buttons but

32964
20:49:43,640 --> 20:49:48,512
I've given each a unique ID so that I

32965
20:49:46,232 --> 20:49:50,400
can reference it in code and then inside

32966
20:49:48,512 --> 20:49:52,920
of a script tag here below because I

32967
20:49:50,400 --> 20:49:55,640
didn't bother with the uh Dom content

32968
20:49:52,920 --> 20:49:57,512
loaded event here notice that I'm doing

32969
20:49:55,640 --> 20:49:59,440
the following I'm creating a variable

32970
20:49:57,512 --> 20:50:02,080
called body that lets me select the body

32971
20:49:59,440 --> 20:50:04,512
tag I then have in these three line some

32972
20:50:02,080 --> 20:50:06,640
code that handles red what am I doing

32973
20:50:04,512 --> 20:50:09,720
well I'm selecting from the document

32974
20:50:06,640 --> 20:50:11,232
whatever h HTML tag has unique ID of red

32975
20:50:09,720 --> 20:50:13,320
and then I'm adding an event listener

32976
20:50:11,232 --> 20:50:15,960
for any click on that button and anytime

32977
20:50:13,320 --> 20:50:17,680
someone clicks on that red button I call

32978
20:50:15,960 --> 20:50:20,232
this function anonymously it doesn't

32979
20:50:17,680 --> 20:50:21,640
even have or need a name and this syntax

32980
20:50:20,232 --> 20:50:24,160
here is powerful because now in

32981
20:50:21,640 --> 20:50:26,920
JavaScript I can alter the CSS of my

32982
20:50:24,160 --> 20:50:29,512
page by doing body which is the tag that

32983
20:50:26,920 --> 20:50:32,400
I selected two lines ago accessing its

32984
20:50:29,512 --> 20:50:34,400
style accessing its background color

32985
20:50:32,400 --> 20:50:36,400
property and setting it equal to quote

32986
20:50:34,400 --> 20:50:38,040
unquote red and I do the same down below

32987
20:50:36,400 --> 20:50:39,400
for green I do the same down below for

32988
20:50:38,040 --> 20:50:41,760
blue and the only thing worth noting

32989
20:50:39,400 --> 20:50:44,280
here is that in CSS it turns out it's

32990
20:50:41,760 --> 20:50:46,599
the case that the CSS property for the

32991
20:50:44,280 --> 20:50:49,120
background color of a page is actually

32992
20:50:46,600 --> 20:50:51,440
background Das color in all lower case

32993
20:50:49,120 --> 20:50:53,640
with a hyphen in between unfortunately

32994
20:50:51,440 --> 20:50:55,760
in the world of JavaScript a hyphen

32995
20:50:53,640 --> 20:50:57,360
would be mistaken for subtraction like

32996
20:50:55,760 --> 20:50:59,439
background minus color which would be

32997
20:50:57,360 --> 20:51:01,920
wrong so the convention in JavaScript is

32998
20:50:59,440 --> 20:51:04,640
when you're trying to manipulate CSS you

32999
20:51:01,920 --> 20:51:06,832
take whatever the property name is uh

33000
20:51:04,640 --> 20:51:09,040
font size background color and you

33001
20:51:06,832 --> 20:51:10,319
change it into so-called camel case here

33002
20:51:09,040 --> 20:51:12,552
you get rid of The Hyphen and you

33003
20:51:10,320 --> 20:51:15,000
capitalize the subsequent words like

33004
20:51:12,552 --> 20:51:16,800
color in this case here all right how

33005
20:51:15,000 --> 20:51:19,552
about another well it turns out back in

33006
20:51:16,800 --> 20:51:21,720
the day back in my day there was a HTML

33007
20:51:19,552 --> 20:51:24,440
tag that would actually allow you to do

33008
20:51:21,720 --> 20:51:26,080
this create blinking text on a screen

33009
20:51:24,440 --> 20:51:28,000
it's rather unpleasant at this rate

33010
20:51:26,080 --> 20:51:29,920
certainly but how might this work well

33011
20:51:28,000 --> 20:51:33,680
it turns out in JavaScript if we take a

33012
20:51:29,920 --> 20:51:36,640
look at the blink. HTML file here we'll

33013
20:51:33,680 --> 20:51:38,599
see that you can in your HTML do

33014
20:51:36,640 --> 20:51:41,192
something literally as simple as hello

33015
20:51:38,600 --> 20:51:43,120
world in the body but then you can call

33016
20:51:41,192 --> 20:51:45,120
this function here turns out just like

33017
20:51:43,120 --> 20:51:46,760
document there's another Global special

33018
20:51:45,120 --> 20:51:48,760
variable you can use in JavaScript and

33019
20:51:46,760 --> 20:51:50,959
browsers called window which refers to

33020
20:51:48,760 --> 20:51:52,599
all things related to the window itself

33021
20:51:50,960 --> 20:51:54,640
the window comes with a set interval

33022
20:51:52,600 --> 20:51:57,320
function which lets you do exactly that

33023
20:51:54,640 --> 20:51:59,319
set an interval in milliseconds and

33024
20:51:57,320 --> 20:52:01,760
after every expiration of that interval

33025
20:51:59,320 --> 20:52:03,760
some function will be called for you so

33026
20:52:01,760 --> 20:52:05,280
in this case it's saying every 50

33027
20:52:03,760 --> 20:52:07,231
milliseconds but let's actually slow

33028
20:52:05,280 --> 20:52:09,720
that down now to 500 milliseconds or for

33029
20:52:07,232 --> 20:52:12,400
one half a second call a function called

33030
20:52:09,720 --> 20:52:13,440
blink notice I do not have parentheses

33031
20:52:12,400 --> 20:52:16,079
after the blink name because I don't

33032
20:52:13,440 --> 20:52:17,872
want to call blink now I want to tell

33033
20:52:16,080 --> 20:52:20,192
JavaScript to call the function called

33034
20:52:17,872 --> 20:52:21,552
blink every 500 milliseconds now we'll

33035
20:52:20,192 --> 20:52:22,871
see in a moment what that code looks

33036
20:52:21,552 --> 20:52:24,959
like but let's go back to the page and

33037
20:52:22,872 --> 20:52:26,872
reload and you'll see now that it's a

33038
20:52:24,960 --> 20:52:29,160
more pleasant blinking if that's even

33039
20:52:26,872 --> 20:52:32,080
the case every half second because I'm

33040
20:52:29,160 --> 20:52:34,360
now firing that event that is I'm uh

33041
20:52:32,080 --> 20:52:36,832
calling that function now every 500

33042
20:52:34,360 --> 20:52:39,000
milliseconds instead how am I doing that

33043
20:52:36,832 --> 20:52:41,439
well this same script tag I've invented

33044
20:52:39,000 --> 20:52:43,040
my own blink function this is has the

33045
20:52:41,440 --> 20:52:45,512
distinction back in the day of actually

33046
20:52:43,040 --> 20:52:48,480
being an HTML tag and among the few tags

33047
20:52:45,512 --> 20:52:49,920
that the world removed and got rid of so

33048
20:52:48,480 --> 20:52:52,319
that it's no longer used because it's

33049
20:52:49,920 --> 20:52:54,232
not all that user friendly but down here

33050
20:52:52,320 --> 20:52:57,040
what am I doing I'm getting the body of

33051
20:52:54,232 --> 20:52:59,280
the document itself with this variable

33052
20:52:57,040 --> 20:53:00,680
and then I'm checking two CSS properties

33053
20:52:59,280 --> 20:53:03,000
that we didn't talk about before but it

33054
20:53:00,680 --> 20:53:05,192
turns out that you can check and set the

33055
20:53:03,000 --> 20:53:07,512
visibility of an element in JavaScript

33056
20:53:05,192 --> 20:53:10,231
by going into that tag checking its

33057
20:53:07,512 --> 20:53:12,680
style and getting its visibility uh

33058
20:53:10,232 --> 20:53:15,232
property and if it happens to equal

33059
20:53:12,680 --> 20:53:18,231
hidden the next line of code here 13

33060
20:53:15,232 --> 20:53:19,800
sets it equal to visible instead else if

33061
20:53:18,232 --> 20:53:21,960
it's not hidden it must already be

33062
20:53:19,800 --> 20:53:24,720
visible and so line 17 flips it the

33063
20:53:21,960 --> 20:53:26,552
other way and changes it to Hidden here

33064
20:53:24,720 --> 20:53:28,800
left hand right hand clearly not talking

33065
20:53:26,552 --> 20:53:31,720
no idea why the opposite of visible Is

33066
20:53:28,800 --> 20:53:33,512
Not Invisible it's indeed visible and

33067
20:53:31,720 --> 20:53:35,232
hidden but this just allows you every

33068
20:53:33,512 --> 20:53:37,680
time this function is called to change

33069
20:53:35,232 --> 20:53:39,760
the property from one value to another

33070
20:53:37,680 --> 20:53:41,159
achieving that blinking effect you can

33071
20:53:39,760 --> 20:53:42,959
do even more powerful things that you

33072
20:53:41,160 --> 20:53:45,400
and I take for granted every day let's

33073
20:53:42,960 --> 20:53:47,512
go into Source 8 and go to autocom

33074
20:53:45,400 --> 20:53:50,680
complete. HTML which I wrote in advance

33075
20:53:47,512 --> 20:53:52,960
and this is a page that also loads into

33076
20:53:50,680 --> 20:53:55,192
memory a really big dictionary that you

33077
20:53:52,960 --> 20:53:56,832
might recall from problem set five and

33078
20:53:55,192 --> 20:54:01,192
if I go ahead and type in something like

33079
20:53:56,832 --> 20:54:03,799
c a t you'll notice dynamically an

33080
20:54:01,192 --> 20:54:05,871
unordered bulleted list appearing below

33081
20:54:03,800 --> 20:54:08,480
the text box that shows you all of the

33082
20:54:05,872 --> 20:54:11,512
words in that dictionary from pet 5 that

33083
20:54:08,480 --> 20:54:13,231
start with c and then CA and then T just

33084
20:54:11,512 --> 20:54:15,680
like the autocomplete you see every day

33085
20:54:13,232 --> 20:54:17,920
on your phone in Google or websites like

33086
20:54:15,680 --> 20:54:20,480
it how is that working well probably I'm

33087
20:54:17,920 --> 20:54:22,400
listening for the key press going up as

33088
20:54:20,480 --> 20:54:24,872
soon as that key is pressed I'm probably

33089
20:54:22,400 --> 20:54:26,920
searching through a big array uh really

33090
20:54:24,872 --> 20:54:29,000
of all of those words maybe using linear

33091
20:54:26,920 --> 20:54:30,959
search maybe binary search if uh faster

33092
20:54:29,000 --> 20:54:33,480
than that and then looking for any

33093
20:54:30,960 --> 20:54:36,512
string in that array that starts with C

33094
20:54:33,480 --> 20:54:39,120
or CA or c a t and then I'm generating

33095
20:54:36,512 --> 20:54:41,480
automattic IC Ally the HTML therefore

33096
20:54:39,120 --> 20:54:43,231
but perhaps most familiar nowadays is

33097
20:54:41,480 --> 20:54:46,440
just how much your phone and your laptop

33098
20:54:43,232 --> 20:54:49,160
know about you and let me go into a

33099
20:54:46,440 --> 20:54:51,680
final example here in Source 8 called

33100
20:54:49,160 --> 20:54:53,232
geolocation HTML which is a term of art

33101
20:54:51,680 --> 20:54:54,871
that just refers to figuring out your

33102
20:54:53,232 --> 20:54:57,040
geography for instance your GPS

33103
20:54:54,872 --> 20:54:59,120
coordinates now here we have a third and

33104
20:54:57,040 --> 20:55:01,280
final Global variable that your browser

33105
20:54:59,120 --> 20:55:03,192
provides you with called Navigator and

33106
20:55:01,280 --> 20:55:04,872
in Navigator there's a special object

33107
20:55:03,192 --> 20:55:07,552
called geolocation that comes with a

33108
20:55:04,872 --> 20:55:11,000
function called get current position

33109
20:55:07,552 --> 20:55:13,280
so if you call Navigator geolocation dog

33110
20:55:11,000 --> 20:55:14,960
getcurrent position and then pass in a

33111
20:55:13,280 --> 20:55:16,640
function of your own that doesn't need a

33112
20:55:14,960 --> 20:55:19,192
name but does take an argument in this

33113
20:55:16,640 --> 20:55:20,800
case I called it position as soon as the

33114
20:55:19,192 --> 20:55:23,159
browser or as soon as the phone has

33115
20:55:20,800 --> 20:55:25,480
figured out where in the world that user

33116
20:55:23,160 --> 20:55:27,480
is with that browser at some latitude

33117
20:55:25,480 --> 20:55:30,000
and longitude the browser will

33118
20:55:27,480 --> 20:55:31,512
automatically call that function for you

33119
20:55:30,000 --> 20:55:32,872
and you can do anything you want with

33120
20:55:31,512 --> 20:55:34,872
the position that comes back the

33121
20:55:32,872 --> 20:55:36,160
latitude and longitude respectively so

33122
20:55:34,872 --> 20:55:38,000
I'm going to use a function that's not

33123
20:55:36,160 --> 20:55:39,680
often that help but for our purposes

33124
20:55:38,000 --> 20:55:41,800
today it's just going to write to the

33125
20:55:39,680 --> 20:55:43,640
document itself to my big rectangular

33126
20:55:41,800 --> 20:55:46,680
region whatever the latitude is then a

33127
20:55:43,640 --> 20:55:48,872
comma and then the longitude as well so

33128
20:55:46,680 --> 20:55:53,280
if we go back with this final flourish

33129
20:55:48,872 --> 20:55:54,920
into Source 8 open up geolocation HTML

33130
20:55:53,280 --> 20:55:57,800
you'll see that my browser first wants

33131
20:55:54,920 --> 20:55:59,640
my permission to let this website my own

33132
20:55:57,800 --> 20:56:01,832
know my location I'm going to go ahead

33133
20:55:59,640 --> 20:56:02,920
and click allow crossing my fingers

33134
20:56:01,832 --> 20:56:04,511
because it might take a moment for the

33135
20:56:02,920 --> 20:56:07,280
phone or the laptop to figure it out and

33136
20:56:04,512 --> 20:56:09,640
it looks like according to Google I am

33137
20:56:07,280 --> 20:56:13,192
right this moment with my Mac at

33138
20:56:09,640 --> 20:56:15,552
latitude longitude 42375 comma

33139
20:56:13,192 --> 20:56:17,319
7111 let's go ahead and highlight and

33140
20:56:15,552 --> 20:56:20,231
copy that let's go to a website like

33141
20:56:17,320 --> 20:56:21,280
Googl maps.com crossing our fingers if

33142
20:56:20,232 --> 20:56:24,552
you've never done this you can search

33143
20:56:21,280 --> 20:56:28,512
for GPS coordinates too let's hit enter

33144
20:56:24,552 --> 20:56:30,959
and amazing we are indeed in Sanders

33145
20:56:28,512 --> 20:56:34,040
Theater roughly there standing on this

33146
20:56:30,960 --> 20:56:36,280
stage on Halloween and that then is week

33147
20:56:34,040 --> 20:56:38,159
eight we will see you next time happy

33148
20:56:36,280 --> 20:56:39,080
Halloween

33149
20:56:38,160 --> 20:56:42,000
nothing

33150
20:56:39,080 --> 20:56:45,832
go buffering

33151
20:56:42,000 --> 20:56:45,832
okay Josh

33152
20:56:48,900 --> 20:56:55,360
[Music]

33153
20:56:50,800 --> 20:56:55,360
nice it's Moy no oh

33154
20:56:58,480 --> 20:57:02,192
wait that was amazing

33155
20:57:02,552 --> 20:57:14,360
Josh uh um Sophie

33156
20:57:07,140 --> 20:57:16,290
[Music]

33157
20:57:14,360 --> 20:57:20,040
amazing that was

33158
20:57:16,290 --> 20:57:23,360
[Music]

33159
20:57:20,040 --> 20:57:25,040
perfect I think I

33160
20:57:23,360 --> 20:57:28,040
hey to

33161
20:57:25,040 --> 20:57:28,040
you

33162
20:57:28,290 --> 20:57:35,640
[Music]

33163
20:57:30,640 --> 20:57:38,640
oh that was amazing thank you all so

33164
20:57:35,640 --> 20:57:38,640
good

33165
20:57:39,160 --> 20:57:47,270
[Music]

33166
20:57:53,250 --> 20:58:01,570
[Music]

33167
20:58:17,870 --> 20:58:36,510
[Music]

33168
20:58:50,360 --> 20:58:53,470
[Music]

33169
20:59:00,290 --> 20:59:13,659
[Music]

33170
20:59:28,000 --> 20:59:33,360
all right this is cs50 and this is

33171
20:59:30,832 --> 20:59:35,599
already week nine which is our second to

33172
20:59:33,360 --> 20:59:37,800
last indeed this is really the last week

33173
20:59:35,600 --> 20:59:39,800
where you'll learn in this class how to

33174
20:59:37,800 --> 20:59:41,680
program but indeed it's this week that's

33175
20:59:39,800 --> 20:59:43,280
really meant to be the the pedagogical

33176
20:59:41,680 --> 20:59:44,832
climax of like all of these various

33177
20:59:43,280 --> 20:59:46,360
languages we've been looking at all of

33178
20:59:44,832 --> 20:59:48,720
these various techniques all of this

33179
20:59:46,360 --> 20:59:50,280
syntax so that at the end of cs50 in

33180
20:59:48,720 --> 20:59:52,080
just a few weeks you indeed feel that

33181
20:59:50,280 --> 20:59:53,959
you didn't take a class on C and you

33182
20:59:52,080 --> 20:59:55,512
didn't take a class on python but you

33183
20:59:53,960 --> 20:59:56,872
really more generally took a class on

33184
20:59:55,512 --> 20:59:59,120
programming because indeed we know

33185
20:59:56,872 --> 21:00:00,920
already about half of you uh will go on

33186
20:59:59,120 --> 21:00:02,599
to study computer science further but

33187
21:00:00,920 --> 21:00:04,480
half of you will not and indeed all of

33188
21:00:02,600 --> 21:00:06,080
your programming chops here on out

33189
21:00:04,480 --> 21:00:08,599
theoretically will have a foundation in

33190
21:00:06,080 --> 21:00:09,920
what we been doing these past many weeks

33191
21:00:08,600 --> 21:00:11,920
but here on out it's really going to be

33192
21:00:09,920 --> 21:00:13,640
up to you to learn some new fangled

33193
21:00:11,920 --> 21:00:15,080
language when it comes out or to follow

33194
21:00:13,640 --> 21:00:17,000
some new trend when some language

33195
21:00:15,080 --> 21:00:19,232
eclipses the ones we've been using as

33196
21:00:17,000 --> 21:00:21,040
more popular as more appropriate for

33197
21:00:19,232 --> 21:00:23,000
problems you want to solve and so today

33198
21:00:21,040 --> 21:00:25,000
really is about synthesizing so many of

33199
21:00:23,000 --> 21:00:26,800
the past few weeks but doing it in the

33200
21:00:25,000 --> 21:00:28,400
context of web programming which For

33201
21:00:26,800 --> 21:00:30,800
Better or For Worse is so very much

33202
21:00:28,400 --> 21:00:32,552
invogue nowadays both on our laptops and

33203
21:00:30,800 --> 21:00:34,320
phones and indeed the languages we

33204
21:00:32,552 --> 21:00:36,512
looked at in recent weeks are used not

33205
21:00:34,320 --> 21:00:38,600
only to make websites but also full

33206
21:00:36,512 --> 21:00:40,120
fledged applications and app stores and

33207
21:00:38,600 --> 21:00:42,192
the like so this really will be the

33208
21:00:40,120 --> 21:00:43,680
culmination of those past several weeks

33209
21:00:42,192 --> 21:00:45,720
and indeed we'll even talk about some

33210
21:00:43,680 --> 21:00:47,231
familiar Concepts like shopping carts

33211
21:00:45,720 --> 21:00:48,680
when you're on Amazon and these things

33212
21:00:47,232 --> 21:00:50,720
called cookies when you're visiting

33213
21:00:48,680 --> 21:00:52,040
websites all of those topics too will

33214
21:00:50,720 --> 21:00:53,600
come into play and you'll have an

33215
21:00:52,040 --> 21:00:55,719
understanding of what all that means

33216
21:00:53,600 --> 21:00:58,360
from the ground up so how did we get

33217
21:00:55,720 --> 21:01:00,872
here well just last week we focused on

33218
21:00:58,360 --> 21:01:02,440
HTML and CSS primarily which are not

33219
21:01:00,872 --> 21:01:04,440
programming languages they're just about

33220
21:01:02,440 --> 21:01:06,800
Aesthetics structuring your data

33221
21:01:04,440 --> 21:01:09,800
presenting your data and so forth um and

33222
21:01:06,800 --> 21:01:11,872
we served the web pages we wrote using

33223
21:01:09,800 --> 21:01:13,960
this program HTTP server this is just

33224
21:01:11,872 --> 21:01:16,160
one such program there's dozens hundreds

33225
21:01:13,960 --> 21:01:17,680
of different web servers that you can

33226
21:01:16,160 --> 21:01:19,232
use out there this is just a super

33227
21:01:17,680 --> 21:01:21,231
simple one we pre-installed in your

33228
21:01:19,232 --> 21:01:23,320
codes space for you in vs code so that

33229
21:01:21,232 --> 21:01:25,360
you can just serve up web pages at the

33230
21:01:23,320 --> 21:01:27,280
end of last week two though we teased

33231
21:01:25,360 --> 21:01:30,192
JavaScript a full-fledged programming

33232
21:01:27,280 --> 21:01:32,232
language that you can use to manipulate

33233
21:01:30,192 --> 21:01:34,280
the users experience for the better to

33234
21:01:32,232 --> 21:01:36,280
make things more Dynamic and interactive

33235
21:01:34,280 --> 21:01:38,360
by actually running code in the user

33236
21:01:36,280 --> 21:01:40,680
users's browser on their Mac their PC

33237
21:01:38,360 --> 21:01:42,040
their phone as opposed to server side

33238
21:01:40,680 --> 21:01:44,719
which up until now is where all of our

33239
21:01:42,040 --> 21:01:46,319
code in C and python has been written so

33240
21:01:44,720 --> 21:01:48,600
you're writing code on a server you're

33241
21:01:46,320 --> 21:01:50,920
serving code from a server but now with

33242
21:01:48,600 --> 21:01:53,480
HTML CSS and JavaScript it's getting

33243
21:01:50,920 --> 21:01:55,552
executed in a browser but today we're

33244
21:01:53,480 --> 21:01:57,552
going to give you one final feature of

33245
21:01:55,552 --> 21:01:59,760
python or really languages like it that

33246
21:01:57,552 --> 21:02:02,120
you can also use code on the server to

33247
21:01:59,760 --> 21:02:04,599
generate automatically dynamically the

33248
21:02:02,120 --> 21:02:06,680
HTML uh the JavaScript the CSS that you

33249
21:02:04,600 --> 21:02:08,552
actually want the user to rece receive

33250
21:02:06,680 --> 21:02:10,760
you don't have to hardcode everything as

33251
21:02:08,552 --> 21:02:12,599
you have when making your own homepage

33252
21:02:10,760 --> 21:02:14,000
well let's consider what what some of

33253
21:02:12,600 --> 21:02:17,120
the building blocks were last week so

33254
21:02:14,000 --> 21:02:19,280
here's a sample URL and over here slash

33255
21:02:17,120 --> 21:02:21,640
is sort of the default page on any web

33256
21:02:19,280 --> 21:02:22,760
server it might be index.html it might

33257
21:02:21,640 --> 21:02:24,480
be something else that's just a

33258
21:02:22,760 --> 21:02:26,400
convention but it refers to whatever the

33259
21:02:24,480 --> 21:02:28,231
default actually is you can visit of

33260
21:02:26,400 --> 21:02:31,280
course when any browser like a URL that

33261
21:02:28,232 --> 21:02:33,160
ends in file. HTML or something else.

33262
21:02:31,280 --> 21:02:36,280
HTML and that literally means your

33263
21:02:33,160 --> 21:02:37,920
browser wants this file on this server

33264
21:02:36,280 --> 21:02:40,512
or of course we saw that it can be a

33265
21:02:37,920 --> 21:02:42,512
folder and inside of that folder is

33266
21:02:40,512 --> 21:02:44,760
presumably some default file name like

33267
21:02:42,512 --> 21:02:47,400
again index.html or you can be more

33268
21:02:44,760 --> 21:02:48,760
explicit like folder file. HTML and

33269
21:02:47,400 --> 21:02:51,120
these more generally we just called

33270
21:02:48,760 --> 21:02:53,080
paths and indeed a path is just a

33271
21:02:51,120 --> 21:02:55,871
location on your Mac your PC or on a

33272
21:02:53,080 --> 21:02:57,552
server of some piece of information but

33273
21:02:55,872 --> 21:02:59,680
today we're just going to rename this

33274
21:02:57,552 --> 21:03:01,000
only to use other common terminology but

33275
21:02:59,680 --> 21:03:02,832
they're really just synonyms today we're

33276
21:03:01,000 --> 21:03:04,960
going to refer to those same things as

33277
21:03:02,832 --> 21:03:07,159
routes because now today we're going to

33278
21:03:04,960 --> 21:03:09,040
ultimately replace HT PTP server which

33279
21:03:07,160 --> 21:03:11,832
just serves up static content that you

33280
21:03:09,040 --> 21:03:13,959
all write with your own web server like

33281
21:03:11,832 --> 21:03:15,959
now you will be the ones controlling

33282
21:03:13,960 --> 21:03:18,192
what it is the server does in response

33283
21:03:15,960 --> 21:03:19,640
to the user in uh requests so that you

33284
21:03:18,192 --> 21:03:21,599
can respond interactively and

33285
21:03:19,640 --> 21:03:23,680
dynamically but we're still going to see

33286
21:03:21,600 --> 21:03:26,280
techniques like this these were our

33287
21:03:23,680 --> 21:03:27,552
so-called HTTP parameters they're

33288
21:03:26,280 --> 21:03:29,680
everything that comes after a question

33289
21:03:27,552 --> 21:03:31,832
mark in a URL and it can be like key

33290
21:03:29,680 --> 21:03:34,159
equals value and an example was what

33291
21:03:31,832 --> 21:03:36,832
when we played with Google what was the

33292
21:03:34,160 --> 21:03:40,040
key and what was the value

33293
21:03:36,832 --> 21:03:40,040
that I first tried any

33294
21:03:40,480 --> 21:03:44,832
recollection I was searching for cats

33295
21:03:42,720 --> 21:03:46,552
and so the key I figured that was Q

33296
21:03:44,832 --> 21:03:48,511
because that's what Larry and Sergey who

33297
21:03:46,552 --> 21:03:51,440
created Google years ago decided the

33298
21:03:48,512 --> 21:03:53,640
name would be of the HTML text box that

33299
21:03:51,440 --> 21:03:55,680
you type your query into and if I type

33300
21:03:53,640 --> 21:03:57,640
cat for cat the value of that would end

33301
21:03:55,680 --> 21:03:59,640
up in the URL for Google as being

33302
21:03:57,640 --> 21:04:01,192
question mark cat equals value and I

33303
21:03:59,640 --> 21:04:02,720
mentioned that it's often the case that

33304
21:04:01,192 --> 21:04:04,599
you want to send two different inputs to

33305
21:04:02,720 --> 21:04:05,960
a server and this is why I propose that

33306
21:04:04,600 --> 21:04:07,832
you just keep an eye out for Amper Sands

33307
21:04:05,960 --> 21:04:09,720
and and Ampersand separate these key

33308
21:04:07,832 --> 21:04:11,319
value pairs but again this is the same

33309
21:04:09,720 --> 21:04:13,080
darn Paradigm as before and we've seen

33310
21:04:11,320 --> 21:04:15,960
this so many times right key value pairs

33311
21:04:13,080 --> 21:04:18,680
in dictionaries in Python we've seen uh

33312
21:04:15,960 --> 21:04:21,320
HTML attributes and their values we've

33313
21:04:18,680 --> 21:04:23,359
seen CSS properties and their values

33314
21:04:21,320 --> 21:04:24,832
it's all the same thing associating

33315
21:04:23,360 --> 21:04:26,640
something with something else even

33316
21:04:24,832 --> 21:04:28,959
though every language every person seems

33317
21:04:26,640 --> 21:04:30,872
to have their own uh vernacular for it

33318
21:04:28,960 --> 21:04:32,360
it really is just the same idea this

33319
21:04:30,872 --> 21:04:35,000
associating of something with something

33320
21:04:32,360 --> 21:04:37,192
else we'll continue to see and here to

33321
21:04:35,000 --> 21:04:40,120
be concrete were the

33322
21:04:37,192 --> 21:04:42,080
HTTP lines of text that were in those

33323
21:04:40,120 --> 21:04:44,120
virtual envelopes if you will if I were

33324
21:04:42,080 --> 21:04:45,872
indeed selecting trying to search for

33325
21:04:44,120 --> 21:04:48,231
something like cats on Google this

33326
21:04:45,872 --> 21:04:50,640
recall was the message that got sent to

33327
21:04:48,232 --> 21:04:52,680
the server by my browser in order to

33328
21:04:50,640 --> 21:04:55,552
tell Google to please search for not

33329
21:04:52,680 --> 21:04:57,439
dogs but in this case cats now what is

33330
21:04:55,552 --> 21:04:59,599
HTTP server been doing for us well it's

33331
21:04:57,440 --> 21:05:02,480
just been serving up HTML files CSS

33332
21:04:59,600 --> 21:05:05,160
files maybe some js or JavaScript files

33333
21:05:02,480 --> 21:05:07,231
but it has been ignoring any HTTP

33334
21:05:05,160 --> 21:05:09,360
parameters like HTTP server does not

33335
21:05:07,232 --> 21:05:10,960
take user input why well what's it going

33336
21:05:09,360 --> 21:05:12,832
to do with it because you already wrote

33337
21:05:10,960 --> 21:05:15,360
the HTML you already wrote the CSS like

33338
21:05:12,832 --> 21:05:17,192
there's no decisions to be made until we

33339
21:05:15,360 --> 21:05:18,720
introduce a proper programming language

33340
21:05:17,192 --> 21:05:20,832
on the server and so we're going to move

33341
21:05:18,720 --> 21:05:23,280
away now from this simple HTTP server

33342
21:05:20,832 --> 21:05:25,480
program and introduce you to your own

33343
21:05:23,280 --> 21:05:27,760
server that's going to handle the

33344
21:05:25,480 --> 21:05:29,440
parsing that is the extraction of these

33345
21:05:27,760 --> 21:05:30,832
key value pairs so that you and I don't

33346
21:05:29,440 --> 21:05:32,760
have to write python code all of a

33347
21:05:30,832 --> 21:05:34,480
sudden that like analyzes this stuff

33348
21:05:32,760 --> 21:05:36,400
figures out what pages requested the key

33349
21:05:34,480 --> 21:05:38,959
value pairs all of that were still going

33350
21:05:36,400 --> 21:05:42,280
to get for free by just using the right

33351
21:05:38,960 --> 21:05:44,280
framework and so today we revisit python

33352
21:05:42,280 --> 21:05:45,640
uh which we've now used in some form the

33353
21:05:44,280 --> 21:05:47,512
past few weeks and indeed it's kind of

33354
21:05:45,640 --> 21:05:49,512
been the glue that allows us to stitch

33355
21:05:47,512 --> 21:05:51,440
together some of our own logic we saw it

33356
21:05:49,512 --> 21:05:54,192
with SQL we're going to now see it with

33357
21:05:51,440 --> 21:05:55,480
HTML CSS and even JavaScript if we want

33358
21:05:54,192 --> 21:05:56,832
and we're also going to see another

33359
21:05:55,480 --> 21:05:58,319
language today not a programming

33360
21:05:56,832 --> 21:05:59,959
language called Ginga and this is going

33361
21:05:58,320 --> 21:06:02,680
to be a common Paradigm in the real

33362
21:05:59,960 --> 21:06:04,400
world whereby different languages

33363
21:06:02,680 --> 21:06:06,319
different libraries different Frameworks

33364
21:06:04,400 --> 21:06:08,319
often like borrow from each other or

33365
21:06:06,320 --> 21:06:09,760
they use uh technologies that someone

33366
21:06:08,320 --> 21:06:12,192
else wrote just so they don't have to

33367
21:06:09,760 --> 21:06:14,159
reinvent that wheel so flask is just a

33368
21:06:12,192 --> 21:06:15,720
framework that is a third party Library

33369
21:06:14,160 --> 21:06:17,320
it's pretty popular nowadays it's

33370
21:06:15,720 --> 21:06:19,920
relatively simple which is why we use it

33371
21:06:17,320 --> 21:06:22,320
in cs50 if you've programmed before cs50

33372
21:06:19,920 --> 21:06:24,400
Jango is another popular framework or

33373
21:06:22,320 --> 21:06:26,080
library in the python sta space but it's

33374
21:06:24,400 --> 21:06:28,599
a little more complicated so we focus on

33375
21:06:26,080 --> 21:06:30,040
flask and Ginga we'll see is not a

33376
21:06:28,600 --> 21:06:32,480
programming language it's just going to

33377
21:06:30,040 --> 21:06:34,599
be some syntax thankfully familiar with

33378
21:06:32,480 --> 21:06:37,599
curly braces that allow us to use

33379
21:06:34,600 --> 21:06:39,040
placeholders in our actual web pages so

33380
21:06:37,600 --> 21:06:40,872
again you'll wrap your minds all

33381
21:06:39,040 --> 21:06:42,280
eventually around where the lines are

33382
21:06:40,872 --> 21:06:43,920
among these various Technologies but

33383
21:06:42,280 --> 21:06:45,280
these are not the interesting ideas the

33384
21:06:43,920 --> 21:06:47,920
interesting ideas are the ones we'll

33385
21:06:45,280 --> 21:06:50,600
focus on in code but starting today

33386
21:06:47,920 --> 21:06:52,720
instead of running HTTP server to serve

33387
21:06:50,600 --> 21:06:55,760
up a static website we'll have you start

33388
21:06:52,720 --> 21:06:58,512
running literally flask space run in

33389
21:06:55,760 --> 21:07:01,511
your terminal window to run your own web

33390
21:06:58,512 --> 21:07:04,400
server that's implemented in Python

33391
21:07:01,512 --> 21:07:07,000
using this flask framework so bootstrap

33392
21:07:04,400 --> 21:07:09,511
was a library for making your CSS and

33393
21:07:07,000 --> 21:07:11,872
JavaScript prettier and more interactive

33394
21:07:09,512 --> 21:07:13,800
flask is a framework or library for just

33395
21:07:11,872 --> 21:07:16,040
making your python code more pleasant to

33396
21:07:13,800 --> 21:07:18,160
use since you're borrowing features from

33397
21:07:16,040 --> 21:07:19,760
someone else all right so how can we go

33398
21:07:18,160 --> 21:07:22,080
about doing this well if you are to

33399
21:07:19,760 --> 21:07:25,040
write your very own web application your

33400
21:07:22,080 --> 21:07:27,552
own amazon.com your own google.com in

33401
21:07:25,040 --> 21:07:30,040
Python using flask minimally you need to

33402
21:07:27,552 --> 21:07:31,760
have a file called app.py by convention

33403
21:07:30,040 --> 21:07:33,680
which is where all your python code goes

33404
21:07:31,760 --> 21:07:35,231
and then a folder called templates which

33405
21:07:33,680 --> 21:07:36,680
is where all of your templates go and

33406
21:07:35,232 --> 21:07:38,800
for now your templates are just your

33407
21:07:36,680 --> 21:07:40,319
HTML files so if we're going to now

33408
21:07:38,800 --> 21:07:42,960
start building more interesting

33409
21:07:40,320 --> 21:07:45,192
interactive things like google.com or

33410
21:07:42,960 --> 21:07:46,600
amazon.com we need to be able to execute

33411
21:07:45,192 --> 21:07:48,640
code on the server and so this is the

33412
21:07:46,600 --> 21:07:50,872
convention it's not index.html anymore

33413
21:07:48,640 --> 21:07:53,000
necessarily it's these two things at the

33414
21:07:50,872 --> 21:07:54,680
top level with that said we'll quickly

33415
21:07:53,000 --> 21:07:57,000
see that there's some other conventions

33416
21:07:54,680 --> 21:07:59,000
and in my examples online and in the uh

33417
21:07:57,000 --> 21:08:01,680
problem set nine you'll see another file

33418
21:07:59,000 --> 21:08:03,640
called requirements.txt which is just a

33419
21:08:01,680 --> 21:08:05,799
text file that allows you to enumerate

33420
21:08:03,640 --> 21:08:07,760
all of the thirdparty libraries your

33421
21:08:05,800 --> 21:08:09,280
application might want to use it's a

33422
21:08:07,760 --> 21:08:11,000
convention so that the server can like

33423
21:08:09,280 --> 21:08:12,832
automatically install things for you

33424
21:08:11,000 --> 21:08:14,480
without you having to do it manually and

33425
21:08:12,832 --> 21:08:16,319
then static is going to be where

33426
21:08:14,480 --> 21:08:17,599
literally your static content goes so if

33427
21:08:16,320 --> 21:08:19,640
you've got images for your web

33428
21:08:17,600 --> 21:08:22,120
application if you've got JavaScript

33429
21:08:19,640 --> 21:08:24,000
files CSS files by convention that goes

33430
21:08:22,120 --> 21:08:25,640
in static these are just conventions

33431
21:08:24,000 --> 21:08:27,872
like all of this can be changed but this

33432
21:08:25,640 --> 21:08:30,120
is like the way to do things so we'll

33433
21:08:27,872 --> 21:08:32,360
introduce you to the defaults all right

33434
21:08:30,120 --> 21:08:34,400
so what does this mean how for instance

33435
21:08:32,360 --> 21:08:37,440
could I go about implementing my own web

33436
21:08:34,400 --> 21:08:40,599
application using python that somehow

33437
21:08:37,440 --> 21:08:43,400
spits out a message like Hello World all

33438
21:08:40,600 --> 21:08:45,400
right well turns out just this now we'll

33439
21:08:43,400 --> 21:08:48,360
tease this apart in just a moment but

33440
21:08:45,400 --> 21:08:50,599
this is the content of a sample app.py

33441
21:08:48,360 --> 21:08:52,480
file that apparently uses some Library

33442
21:08:50,600 --> 21:08:54,080
stuff like familiar syntax from

33443
21:08:52,480 --> 21:08:56,192
something import something else we've

33444
21:08:54,080 --> 21:08:58,552
seen that before with csvs and other

33445
21:08:56,192 --> 21:09:00,440
libraries this is somewhat new syntax

33446
21:08:58,552 --> 21:09:01,959
but it's kind of copy paste for now this

33447
21:09:00,440 --> 21:09:03,680
is definitely new syntax and kind of

33448
21:09:01,960 --> 21:09:05,400
weird with the at sign here but we'll

33449
21:09:03,680 --> 21:09:07,159
see this again and again today and it's

33450
21:09:05,400 --> 21:09:08,959
just copy paste initially until you

33451
21:09:07,160 --> 21:09:10,720
understand what it's doing for you but

33452
21:09:08,960 --> 21:09:13,080
at least there's some familiar stuff

33453
21:09:10,720 --> 21:09:15,552
here like index.html is still going to

33454
21:09:13,080 --> 21:09:17,920
be with us but it's going to be up to us

33455
21:09:15,552 --> 21:09:19,552
when and how to show it to the user so

33456
21:09:17,920 --> 21:09:23,400
let's make this more real let me go over

33457
21:09:19,552 --> 21:09:26,280
to vs code here and let me go ahead and

33458
21:09:23,400 --> 21:09:28,799
create a how about we'll do this in

33459
21:09:26,280 --> 21:09:30,232
hello let me do makeer hello to make a

33460
21:09:28,800 --> 21:09:32,160
new folder called hello and I'm going to

33461
21:09:30,232 --> 21:09:33,720
CD into it just to isolate all of these

33462
21:09:32,160 --> 21:09:35,080
files to the same directory so that we

33463
21:09:33,720 --> 21:09:38,512
have different apps today and different

33464
21:09:35,080 --> 21:09:40,440
folders and now I'm going to do code of

33465
21:09:38,512 --> 21:09:43,760
let's do this actually let's do our

33466
21:09:40,440 --> 21:09:45,832
maker templates. HTM ah sorry not

33467
21:09:43,760 --> 21:09:48,080
templates. HTML let me rename that to

33468
21:09:45,832 --> 21:09:49,360
templates using the MV command this has

33469
21:09:48,080 --> 21:09:51,832
nothing to do with web programming this

33470
21:09:49,360 --> 21:09:54,280
is me making typos so if I type LS now

33471
21:09:51,832 --> 21:09:56,599
I've got a folder called templates all

33472
21:09:54,280 --> 21:09:59,080
right in there let's create a file

33473
21:09:56,600 --> 21:10:01,080
called index.html that is going to be

33474
21:09:59,080 --> 21:10:02,760
super simple and pretty much copy paste

33475
21:10:01,080 --> 21:10:05,040
from last week let me hide my terminal

33476
21:10:02,760 --> 21:10:07,231
window and let me just very quickly whip

33477
21:10:05,040 --> 21:10:10,871
up a simp simple hello world page using

33478
21:10:07,232 --> 21:10:13,280
my HTML tag Lang will equal English then

33479
21:10:10,872 --> 21:10:15,360
inside of this I'm going to have a head

33480
21:10:13,280 --> 21:10:16,720
tag inside of this I'm going to have a

33481
21:10:15,360 --> 21:10:18,760
title tag and I'm just going to call

33482
21:10:16,720 --> 21:10:20,760
this thing hello uh I'm going to then

33483
21:10:18,760 --> 21:10:22,680
have a body and in this I'm only going

33484
21:10:20,760 --> 21:10:24,360
to say something simple like hello comma

33485
21:10:22,680 --> 21:10:26,079
world and just so this is mobile

33486
21:10:24,360 --> 21:10:28,040
friendly recall that we touched on these

33487
21:10:26,080 --> 21:10:29,360
meta tags so just in case you after

33488
21:10:28,040 --> 21:10:31,480
class play with your mobile device

33489
21:10:29,360 --> 21:10:33,320
instead of your laptop I'll do name

33490
21:10:31,480 --> 21:10:36,512
equals quote unquote

33491
21:10:33,320 --> 21:10:38,040
viewport uh viewport and and content

33492
21:10:36,512 --> 21:10:39,400
equals and I never remember this I'm

33493
21:10:38,040 --> 21:10:43,280
literally reading it off of a cheat

33494
21:10:39,400 --> 21:10:45,511
sheet initial scale equals 1 width

33495
21:10:43,280 --> 21:10:47,872
equals device width and this is just

33496
21:10:45,512 --> 21:10:49,320
this magical incantation that says to

33497
21:10:47,872 --> 21:10:51,800
the browser like size things

33498
21:10:49,320 --> 21:10:54,000
appropriately for the size of the device

33499
21:10:51,800 --> 21:10:55,232
it blows up the font sizes a bit all

33500
21:10:54,000 --> 21:10:57,120
right so that's what I would have done

33501
21:10:55,232 --> 21:10:59,192
last week and I would have served this

33502
21:10:57,120 --> 21:11:00,832
web page by running HTTP server in the

33503
21:10:59,192 --> 21:11:02,920
same directory and boom I would see that

33504
21:11:00,832 --> 21:11:05,159
HTML but let's now start to take some

33505
21:11:02,920 --> 21:11:06,599
control over the user's experience and

33506
21:11:05,160 --> 21:11:08,000
for now it's going to be underwhelming

33507
21:11:06,600 --> 21:11:10,232
it's just going to always say hello

33508
21:11:08,000 --> 21:11:12,680
world but in a moment version two is

33509
21:11:10,232 --> 21:11:14,552
going to say hello David or hello Carter

33510
21:11:12,680 --> 21:11:16,280
a bit more dynamically and we'll quickly

33511
21:11:14,552 --> 21:11:18,120
escalate from there to just more

33512
21:11:16,280 --> 21:11:19,832
interesting applications as well

33513
21:11:18,120 --> 21:11:22,000
culminating with things like cookies and

33514
21:11:19,832 --> 21:11:24,231
shopping carts and the like so let me go

33515
21:11:22,000 --> 21:11:25,920
back into my terminal window and as

33516
21:11:24,232 --> 21:11:27,160
promised let me create another file

33517
21:11:25,920 --> 21:11:29,760
called

33518
21:11:27,160 --> 21:11:31,760
app.py and this is where now I need to

33519
21:11:29,760 --> 21:11:34,040
implement the web server I'm going to

33520
21:11:31,760 --> 21:11:35,439
run using this flask framework and for

33521
21:11:34,040 --> 21:11:37,832
now I'm just going to kind of do some

33522
21:11:35,440 --> 21:11:40,000
copy paste from uh what we saw on the

33523
21:11:37,832 --> 21:11:41,920
slide a moment ago from the flask

33524
21:11:40,000 --> 21:11:45,720
Library which we've pre-installed for

33525
21:11:41,920 --> 21:11:48,480
you I'm going to import a uh function

33526
21:11:45,720 --> 21:11:50,400
called flask capital F it's subtle but

33527
21:11:48,480 --> 21:11:52,440
it's important there and I'm also going

33528
21:11:50,400 --> 21:11:55,231
to import a few other things a function

33529
21:11:52,440 --> 21:11:57,720
called render template and another

33530
21:11:55,232 --> 21:11:59,640
variable called request and the only way

33531
21:11:57,720 --> 21:12:01,800
I know this is from having taught this

33532
21:11:59,640 --> 21:12:03,400
before read the documentation followed a

33533
21:12:01,800 --> 21:12:04,920
tutorial like you wouldn't know this

33534
21:12:03,400 --> 21:12:06,552
unless someone told you or you read how

33535
21:12:04,920 --> 21:12:09,319
to do this this but what this means is

33536
21:12:06,552 --> 21:12:11,192
that this Library called flask has three

33537
21:12:09,320 --> 21:12:12,872
things in it a function called flask

33538
21:12:11,192 --> 21:12:15,040
capital f a function called render

33539
21:12:12,872 --> 21:12:16,800
template and a variable built into it

33540
21:12:15,040 --> 21:12:18,799
called request and this is going to be

33541
21:12:16,800 --> 21:12:20,640
all the building blocks I need to

33542
21:12:18,800 --> 21:12:21,960
implement my own web server the

33543
21:12:20,640 --> 21:12:24,192
convention in flask when you want to

33544
21:12:21,960 --> 21:12:26,640
create a web app in Python is you create

33545
21:12:24,192 --> 21:12:28,760
a variable by convention called app and

33546
21:12:26,640 --> 21:12:31,640
then you assign it the return value of

33547
21:12:28,760 --> 21:12:34,439
that flask function capital F and pass

33548
21:12:31,640 --> 21:12:36,960
into it underscore uncore name uncore

33549
21:12:34,440 --> 21:12:39,232
underscore which is weird but we have

33550
21:12:36,960 --> 21:12:41,960
seen this before a few weeks ago anyone

33551
21:12:39,232 --> 21:12:43,872
recall when and why we mentioned uncore

33552
21:12:41,960 --> 21:12:48,080
uncore name uncore

33553
21:12:43,872 --> 21:12:48,080
uncore yeah I think was

33554
21:12:48,640 --> 21:12:54,600
it name or something yeah if we wanted

33555
21:12:51,720 --> 21:12:58,080
to check if the name of the file was

33556
21:12:54,600 --> 21:12:59,400
itself main so that we avoided a

33557
21:12:58,080 --> 21:13:01,320
situation where if you're writing your

33558
21:12:59,400 --> 21:13:03,552
own Library code you don't want your

33559
21:13:01,320 --> 21:13:05,720
code to be executed automatically you

33560
21:13:03,552 --> 21:13:07,400
want to potentially execute the main

33561
21:13:05,720 --> 21:13:09,512
function and that was a solution to that

33562
21:13:07,400 --> 21:13:10,832
problem here for today's purposes this

33563
21:13:09,512 --> 21:13:12,480
is just the way you do it underscore

33564
21:13:10,832 --> 21:13:14,120
underscore name underscore uncore refers

33565
21:13:12,480 --> 21:13:16,360
to the current file and so this is just

33566
21:13:14,120 --> 21:13:18,440
a little trick that says turn this file

33567
21:13:16,360 --> 21:13:22,000
into a flask application that's all it

33568
21:13:18,440 --> 21:13:23,600
is and for now uh that line suffices all

33569
21:13:22,000 --> 21:13:25,640
right what do I want to do after that

33570
21:13:23,600 --> 21:13:28,232
well now I'm in charge of the web server

33571
21:13:25,640 --> 21:13:31,000
I need to write the code that decides

33572
21:13:28,232 --> 21:13:33,080
based on the browsers request what file

33573
21:13:31,000 --> 21:13:35,280
or files I'm going to send from the

33574
21:13:33,080 --> 21:13:36,872
server to the browser last week http

33575
21:13:35,280 --> 21:13:38,552
server did all of this for us just based

33576
21:13:36,872 --> 21:13:40,872
on the file name but today I'm going to

33577
21:13:38,552 --> 21:13:42,832
take over control over that process and

33578
21:13:40,872 --> 21:13:46,552
the way I do that is as follows I say

33579
21:13:42,832 --> 21:13:48,799
app. route with weirdly an at sign in

33580
21:13:46,552 --> 21:13:50,872
front of it this is known in python as a

33581
21:13:48,800 --> 21:13:52,360
decorator and it's a feature of python

33582
21:13:50,872 --> 21:13:54,192
not a flask that we just didn't

33583
21:13:52,360 --> 21:13:56,600
introduce in weeks past but it's a

33584
21:13:54,192 --> 21:13:58,552
special it's a handy trick to do what

33585
21:13:56,600 --> 21:14:01,720
we're about to do the route I want to

33586
21:13:58,552 --> 21:14:04,319
Define is quote unquote slash so that is

33587
21:14:01,720 --> 21:14:06,600
here is code I want the server to

33588
21:14:04,320 --> 21:14:09,000
execute whenever I user visits forward

33589
21:14:06,600 --> 21:14:10,800
slash the default page of the website

33590
21:14:09,000 --> 21:14:12,680
well what code do I want them to execute

33591
21:14:10,800 --> 21:14:14,360
well I want them to execute a function

33592
21:14:12,680 --> 21:14:16,040
and I can therefore Define in Python a

33593
21:14:14,360 --> 21:14:18,872
function I can technically call this

33594
21:14:16,040 --> 21:14:20,400
thing anything I want X or Y or Z but

33595
21:14:18,872 --> 21:14:22,400
because they're accessing the default

33596
21:14:20,400 --> 21:14:24,400
page otherwise known as the index of the

33597
21:14:22,400 --> 21:14:26,159
site I'm going to just more reasonably

33598
21:14:24,400 --> 21:14:27,552
call this function index but just a

33599
21:14:26,160 --> 21:14:29,920
convention you could call it anything

33600
21:14:27,552 --> 21:14:32,120
you want but X Y or Z is probably a bad

33601
21:14:29,920 --> 21:14:34,232
stylistic choice it doesn't need to take

33602
21:14:32,120 --> 21:14:35,871
any arguments in this case and the only

33603
21:14:34,232 --> 21:14:40,080
thing this code this function is going

33604
21:14:35,872 --> 21:14:44,120
to do is for now let's go ahead and have

33605
21:14:40,080 --> 21:14:47,680
it return hello world quote unquote and

33606
21:14:44,120 --> 21:14:50,000
that's it all right now let me go into

33607
21:14:47,680 --> 21:14:52,480
my terminal window let me go ahead and

33608
21:14:50,000 --> 21:14:54,760
do flask run in the same directory that

33609
21:14:52,480 --> 21:14:56,800
has appy and hit enter I'm going to see

33610
21:14:54,760 --> 21:14:59,680
some cryptic output but including a URL

33611
21:14:56,800 --> 21:15:01,360
of my code space and if I open that URL

33612
21:14:59,680 --> 21:15:03,832
after hovering over it I'll indeed see

33613
21:15:01,360 --> 21:15:06,080
hello world as you might hope but let me

33614
21:15:03,832 --> 21:15:08,720
do this let me go ahead and rightclick

33615
21:15:06,080 --> 21:15:10,040
on the page and click view page source

33616
21:15:08,720 --> 21:15:12,280
which if you haven't done before shows

33617
21:15:10,040 --> 21:15:14,480
you all of the HTML for a page however

33618
21:15:12,280 --> 21:15:16,600
pretty or messy it is and that's it

33619
21:15:14,480 --> 21:15:19,599
there's no HTML that I've spit out it's

33620
21:15:16,600 --> 21:15:21,480
just quote unquote hello world well if I

33621
21:15:19,600 --> 21:15:23,160
actually want to spit out a full web

33622
21:15:21,480 --> 21:15:24,512
page which is not a big deal here

33623
21:15:23,160 --> 21:15:26,960
because who cares it's just the text

33624
21:15:24,512 --> 21:15:30,600
anyway but if I want to spit out a whole

33625
21:15:26,960 --> 21:15:33,040
file let me do this I want to return

33626
21:15:30,600 --> 21:15:34,552
essentially the contents of index.html

33627
21:15:33,040 --> 21:15:36,832
which have all of the tags I want the

33628
21:15:34,552 --> 21:15:39,512
mobile friend stuff and all of that well

33629
21:15:36,832 --> 21:15:42,552
I can't just return index.html but I can

33630
21:15:39,512 --> 21:15:44,080
return this render template quote

33631
21:15:42,552 --> 21:15:46,319
unquote

33632
21:15:44,080 --> 21:15:48,232
index.html and per the documentation for

33633
21:15:46,320 --> 21:15:50,232
flask this render template function will

33634
21:15:48,232 --> 21:15:52,872
go find that file for me in my templates

33635
21:15:50,232 --> 21:15:54,400
folder by convention it will open it up

33636
21:15:52,872 --> 21:15:56,800
and then it will spit the whole thing

33637
21:15:54,400 --> 21:15:58,640
out to the browser for me so I can keep

33638
21:15:56,800 --> 21:16:01,720
all my HTML in one place and all my

33639
21:15:58,640 --> 21:16:04,512
python code in this one place so now if

33640
21:16:01,720 --> 21:16:06,320
I go back to my browser and reload I

33641
21:16:04,512 --> 21:16:08,512
don't think I'll really see a difference

33642
21:16:06,320 --> 21:16:11,320
because it's the same text ultimately

33643
21:16:08,512 --> 21:16:14,320
but if I view page Source now notice

33644
21:16:11,320 --> 21:16:16,720
that ah there is all of the HTML that

33645
21:16:14,320 --> 21:16:18,720
was just sent to the browser so this is

33646
21:16:16,720 --> 21:16:20,640
only to say we have the building blocks

33647
21:16:18,720 --> 21:16:22,512
the puzzle pieces if you will via which

33648
21:16:20,640 --> 21:16:24,360
to now store all of our HTML in one

33649
21:16:22,512 --> 21:16:27,040
place and presumably CSS JavaScript and

33650
21:16:24,360 --> 21:16:28,832
so forth but then serve up whatever we

33651
21:16:27,040 --> 21:16:30,719
want even though I'm just blindly

33652
21:16:28,832 --> 21:16:33,159
spitting out

33653
21:16:30,720 --> 21:16:35,640
index.html so before we proceed any

33654
21:16:33,160 --> 21:16:38,440
questions on this which again I claim is

33655
21:16:35,640 --> 21:16:40,120
like my manual version of what HTTP

33656
21:16:38,440 --> 21:16:42,120
server was doing for us automatically

33657
21:16:40,120 --> 21:16:44,552
last week but this is how you do it

33658
21:16:42,120 --> 21:16:46,599
yourself any

33659
21:16:44,552 --> 21:16:48,760
questions all right well let's make it

33660
21:16:46,600 --> 21:16:51,920
more interesting which we could not do

33661
21:16:48,760 --> 21:16:55,159
with HTTP server and HTML alone why

33662
21:16:51,920 --> 21:16:56,959
don't we go ahead and do this let me

33663
21:16:55,160 --> 21:16:59,440
visit the same URL and I'm going to zoom

33664
21:16:56,960 --> 21:17:01,120
in and your url will differ from my code

33665
21:16:59,440 --> 21:17:03,872
space but it's going to end similarly

33666
21:17:01,120 --> 21:17:07,120
here I'm going to do slash question mark

33667
21:17:03,872 --> 21:17:09,320
name equals David for instance or Q

33668
21:17:07,120 --> 21:17:11,159
equals cats or name equals Carter any

33669
21:17:09,320 --> 21:17:13,512
key value pair I want I'm going to

33670
21:17:11,160 --> 21:17:15,040
append after a slash and a question mark

33671
21:17:13,512 --> 21:17:17,192
thereby providing user input to the

33672
21:17:15,040 --> 21:17:18,640
server albe it in a very user unfriendly

33673
21:17:17,192 --> 21:17:21,440
way no one's going to normally do this

33674
21:17:18,640 --> 21:17:23,000
in their browser enter nothing changes

33675
21:17:21,440 --> 21:17:24,552
here it just says hello world but

33676
21:17:23,000 --> 21:17:26,872
wouldn't it be nice if it says hello

33677
21:17:24,552 --> 21:17:28,920
David or equivalently if I zoom in here

33678
21:17:26,872 --> 21:17:30,640
again and change David to Carter and hit

33679
21:17:28,920 --> 21:17:33,080
enter wouldn't it be nice if it says

33680
21:17:30,640 --> 21:17:35,960
hello Carter instead so we need some

33681
21:17:33,080 --> 21:17:39,040
dynamism there and here's now python is

33682
21:17:35,960 --> 21:17:43,160
going to be our friend if I want to

33683
21:17:39,040 --> 21:17:45,319
access the HTTP parameters that the user

33684
21:17:43,160 --> 21:17:47,680
has provided via the URL be it Q equals

33685
21:17:45,320 --> 21:17:50,000
cats or name equals David I can use this

33686
21:17:47,680 --> 21:17:52,832
special variable I already preemptively

33687
21:17:50,000 --> 21:17:55,280
imported earlier and I can do this if

33688
21:17:52,832 --> 21:17:59,040
there is an HTTP parameter called name

33689
21:17:55,280 --> 21:18:00,600
in what I'm going to call request. args

33690
21:17:59,040 --> 21:18:02,760
then I'm going to go ahead and create a

33691
21:18:00,600 --> 21:18:05,360
variable called name and I'm going to

33692
21:18:02,760 --> 21:18:08,599
set it equal to request. args bracket

33693
21:18:05,360 --> 21:18:10,960
name else if there is no quote unquote

33694
21:18:08,600 --> 21:18:12,872
name key in this special variable called

33695
21:18:10,960 --> 21:18:15,400
request. args I'm going to just assume

33696
21:18:12,872 --> 21:18:17,040
that the user's name is World by default

33697
21:18:15,400 --> 21:18:18,832
now what's going on here well it turns

33698
21:18:17,040 --> 21:18:21,480
out that flask provides us with this

33699
21:18:18,832 --> 21:18:24,799
special variable called request. ARs and

33700
21:18:21,480 --> 21:18:27,640
in there is all of the key value pairs

33701
21:18:24,800 --> 21:18:31,080
that might have come in via the URL so

33702
21:18:27,640 --> 21:18:34,360
if you had to guess what type of data or

33703
21:18:31,080 --> 21:18:36,832
what data type is request. args that's

33704
21:18:34,360 --> 21:18:40,120
its name and here is in context line n

33705
21:18:36,832 --> 21:18:42,799
might provide a clue in Python what data

33706
21:18:40,120 --> 21:18:44,760
type might request. args

33707
21:18:42,800 --> 21:18:47,192
be

33708
21:18:44,760 --> 21:18:49,000
yeah uh it's not going to be an array or

33709
21:18:47,192 --> 21:18:50,760
a list because those are always in every

33710
21:18:49,000 --> 21:18:52,600
language we've seen numerically indexed

33711
21:18:50,760 --> 21:18:56,319
but you're

33712
21:18:52,600 --> 21:18:58,600
close someone else it's a dictionary so

33713
21:18:56,320 --> 21:19:00,680
a dictionary is similar syntactically to

33714
21:18:58,600 --> 21:19:03,400
a list in Python but instead of numeric

33715
21:19:00,680 --> 21:19:05,511
indices like 012 you can literally use

33716
21:19:03,400 --> 21:19:06,799
strings like quote unquote name now

33717
21:19:05,512 --> 21:19:08,480
that's a bit of a white lie it is a

33718
21:19:06,800 --> 21:19:10,192
dictionary but it's flask's special

33719
21:19:08,480 --> 21:19:12,192
fancy version of a dictionary but the

33720
21:19:10,192 --> 21:19:14,400
syntax via which you can access it is

33721
21:19:12,192 --> 21:19:16,512
exactly the same and I actually this is

33722
21:19:14,400 --> 21:19:18,799
a typo I didn't mean to say names there

33723
21:19:16,512 --> 21:19:21,000
I meant to say name singular but

33724
21:19:18,800 --> 21:19:23,232
otherwise I think the code is correct

33725
21:19:21,000 --> 21:19:25,360
this is going to on line eight check if

33726
21:19:23,232 --> 21:19:27,552
there's a key called name in request.

33727
21:19:25,360 --> 21:19:29,512
ARs and if so it's going to set it equal

33728
21:19:27,552 --> 21:19:32,400
to that value otherwise it's going to

33729
21:19:29,512 --> 21:19:35,680
default to world I deliberately did not

33730
21:19:32,400 --> 21:19:39,040
do this I added this IFL

33731
21:19:35,680 --> 21:19:43,231
and did not do this why what error might

33732
21:19:39,040 --> 21:19:43,231
happen if I just blindly grab

33733
21:19:44,872 --> 21:19:49,400
name exactly if there was nothing at the

33734
21:19:47,360 --> 21:19:51,800
end of the URL that was of the form

33735
21:19:49,400 --> 21:19:54,439
question mark name equals someone then

33736
21:19:51,800 --> 21:19:55,920
there would be no name key and this is

33737
21:19:54,440 --> 21:19:57,440
uh you know a couple weeks back but this

33738
21:19:55,920 --> 21:19:58,959
would give you one of those annoying key

33739
21:19:57,440 --> 21:20:00,512
errors when you get a trace back because

33740
21:19:58,960 --> 21:20:02,192
you screwed up because you used a string

33741
21:20:00,512 --> 21:20:03,760
that doesn't exist that's why I'm just

33742
21:20:02,192 --> 21:20:05,120
proactively trying to avoid that

33743
21:20:03,760 --> 21:20:06,680
situation just like I'm might have a

33744
21:20:05,120 --> 21:20:09,080
couple of weeks ago so even though it's

33745
21:20:06,680 --> 21:20:11,719
more verbose this is just much more

33746
21:20:09,080 --> 21:20:13,440
defensive so that I don't accidentally

33747
21:20:11,720 --> 21:20:15,080
index into a dictionary where there is

33748
21:20:13,440 --> 21:20:17,360
no key but we'll see how we can tighten

33749
21:20:15,080 --> 21:20:19,920
this up to be not four lines but one but

33750
21:20:17,360 --> 21:20:23,760
I think now I can do this wouldn't it be

33751
21:20:19,920 --> 21:20:25,920
nice if now in my index.html file which

33752
21:20:23,760 --> 21:20:27,680
recall is in my templates folder

33753
21:20:25,920 --> 21:20:30,040
wouldn't it be nice if I could do the

33754
21:20:27,680 --> 21:20:33,231
equivalent in C of like a percent s here

33755
21:20:30,040 --> 21:20:35,832
for instance or in Python something like

33756
21:20:33,232 --> 21:20:37,640
this name well it's close and this is

33757
21:20:35,832 --> 21:20:39,832
just because different humans invent

33758
21:20:37,640 --> 21:20:43,552
different languages invent different uh

33759
21:20:39,832 --> 21:20:46,000
Frameworks the Syntax for this in flask

33760
21:20:43,552 --> 21:20:49,480
is to actually do whoops two curly

33761
21:20:46,000 --> 21:20:52,720
braces and then name of the variable

33762
21:20:49,480 --> 21:20:54,319
inside of it why it's just probably

33763
21:20:52,720 --> 21:20:55,680
someone figured what are the odds that a

33764
21:20:54,320 --> 21:20:58,192
normal person is ever going to use two

33765
21:20:55,680 --> 21:20:59,280
curly braces at once versus just one so

33766
21:20:58,192 --> 21:21:00,720
this is probably decreasing the

33767
21:20:59,280 --> 21:21:03,600
probability that people actually want to

33768
21:21:00,720 --> 21:21:05,400
Output literal curly braces like this so

33769
21:21:03,600 --> 21:21:07,000
it's similar in spirit to Python's F

33770
21:21:05,400 --> 21:21:08,599
strings it's similar in spirit to C's

33771
21:21:07,000 --> 21:21:11,192
percent s it's similar in spirit to

33772
21:21:08,600 --> 21:21:13,400
sql's question marks same idea slightly

33773
21:21:11,192 --> 21:21:15,799
different syntax and this there is

33774
21:21:13,400 --> 21:21:18,040
ginger so it's not programming code per

33775
21:21:15,800 --> 21:21:19,480
se it's just a template and indeed

33776
21:21:18,040 --> 21:21:21,480
that's why this folder is called

33777
21:21:19,480 --> 21:21:23,552
templates it is sort of like a a

33778
21:21:21,480 --> 21:21:24,959
blueprint for what I want to be spit out

33779
21:21:23,552 --> 21:21:26,832
to the user but I've got these

33780
21:21:24,960 --> 21:21:29,480
placeholders like this variable that I

33781
21:21:26,832 --> 21:21:32,360
want to plug into that value now this

33782
21:21:29,480 --> 21:21:35,120
alone is not enough watch what happens

33783
21:21:32,360 --> 21:21:37,600
if I go back to my other browser and I

33784
21:21:35,120 --> 21:21:40,319
reload the page after changing up here

33785
21:21:37,600 --> 21:21:44,232
let's do name equals David again enter

33786
21:21:40,320 --> 21:21:46,680
nothing outputs after the hello comma so

33787
21:21:44,232 --> 21:21:49,280
it seems that the name variable doesn't

33788
21:21:46,680 --> 21:21:50,832
exist yet and that's why indeed if I do

33789
21:21:49,280 --> 21:21:52,832
view page Source you can see what was

33790
21:21:50,832 --> 21:21:54,720
sent to the browser something's wrong

33791
21:21:52,832 --> 21:21:56,760
with my placeholder but I just need to

33792
21:21:54,720 --> 21:21:59,160
be a little more explicit as to what I

33793
21:21:56,760 --> 21:22:01,799
want to send where so it turns out that

33794
21:21:59,160 --> 21:22:03,160
the render template function takes not

33795
21:22:01,800 --> 21:22:04,800
just one argument the name of the

33796
21:22:03,160 --> 21:22:07,920
template you want to spit out but it

33797
21:22:04,800 --> 21:22:10,440
takes after that with commas all of the

33798
21:22:07,920 --> 21:22:13,232
placeholders you want to plug in so for

33799
21:22:10,440 --> 21:22:15,800
instance if you want the placeholder to

33800
21:22:13,232 --> 21:22:18,192
be this literally placeholder inside of

33801
21:22:15,800 --> 21:22:20,080
those curly braces you can then specify

33802
21:22:18,192 --> 21:22:23,920
as the second argument to rep uh render

33803
21:22:20,080 --> 21:22:27,600
template a placeholder named argument

33804
21:22:23,920 --> 21:22:29,599
equals whatever the name is so name is

33805
21:22:27,600 --> 21:22:31,720
the variable in the lines above

33806
21:22:29,600 --> 21:22:33,832
placeholder is the name of my literal

33807
21:22:31,720 --> 21:22:36,160
placeholder in the curly braces and so

33808
21:22:33,832 --> 21:22:38,360
now if I go back to my browser and

33809
21:22:36,160 --> 21:22:39,832
reload this with still quote unquote

33810
21:22:38,360 --> 21:22:43,832
with still question mark name equals

33811
21:22:39,832 --> 21:22:46,040
David in the URL now I indeed see hello

33812
21:22:43,832 --> 21:22:47,720
comma David and if I zoom in here and

33813
21:22:46,040 --> 21:22:50,552
let me move over here let me type in

33814
21:22:47,720 --> 21:22:53,120
Carter and hit enter now I see Hello

33815
21:22:50,552 --> 21:22:54,832
Carter instead now this is a little

33816
21:22:53,120 --> 21:22:56,552
unnecessary to explicitly call the

33817
21:22:54,832 --> 21:22:58,319
placeholder placeholder especially if

33818
21:22:56,552 --> 21:22:59,720
you want to have two or three of them so

33819
21:22:58,320 --> 21:23:01,160
you can actually call this anything you

33820
21:22:59,720 --> 21:23:02,400
want and I'm going to change it back to

33821
21:23:01,160 --> 21:23:04,600
name which is a little more

33822
21:23:02,400 --> 21:23:06,640
straightforward the only weird thing

33823
21:23:04,600 --> 21:23:08,192
here is that now you'll see that you're

33824
21:23:06,640 --> 21:23:10,280
writing code like this and this is

33825
21:23:08,192 --> 21:23:12,599
correct and this is the norm it just

33826
21:23:10,280 --> 21:23:15,040
looks weird but the thing on the left of

33827
21:23:12,600 --> 21:23:17,040
the equal sign is the placeholder you're

33828
21:23:15,040 --> 21:23:19,040
using in the template the thing on the

33829
21:23:17,040 --> 21:23:21,480
right can be any value you want

33830
21:23:19,040 --> 21:23:23,231
including a variable so even though I'm

33831
21:23:21,480 --> 21:23:24,800
naming them exactly the same which looks

33832
21:23:23,232 --> 21:23:27,680
stupid admittedly like this is what

33833
21:23:24,800 --> 21:23:29,440
people tend to do just because it's uh

33834
21:23:27,680 --> 21:23:33,280
simpler than introducing another word

33835
21:23:29,440 --> 21:23:34,920
like placeholder any questions now on

33836
21:23:33,280 --> 21:23:36,800
this

33837
21:23:34,920 --> 21:23:38,832
any questions on these

33838
21:23:36,800 --> 21:23:40,872
placeholders no all right well let's

33839
21:23:38,832 --> 21:23:43,040
tighten this up a little bit and see if

33840
21:23:40,872 --> 21:23:46,800
we can't get things to be more Dynamic

33841
21:23:43,040 --> 21:23:48,920
still let me propose now that instead of

33842
21:23:46,800 --> 21:23:50,920
outputting instead of using this

33843
21:23:48,920 --> 21:23:52,552
condition which made a very simple idea

33844
21:23:50,920 --> 21:23:54,512
like very verbose with four different

33845
21:23:52,552 --> 21:23:56,920
lines it turns out there's an easier way

33846
21:23:54,512 --> 21:23:58,960
to do this you can actually still create

33847
21:23:56,920 --> 21:24:02,080
a variable called name and you can set

33848
21:23:58,960 --> 21:24:04,872
it equal to request. args but instead of

33849
21:24:02,080 --> 21:24:08,360
just blindly indexing into to that

33850
21:24:04,872 --> 21:24:11,440
dictionary it turns out that request.

33851
21:24:08,360 --> 21:24:13,720
ARS comes with a function as well called

33852
21:24:11,440 --> 21:24:17,080
get you can pass it an argument that

33853
21:24:13,720 --> 21:24:20,552
tells you what value you want to get and

33854
21:24:17,080 --> 21:24:22,960
by default if there is no key called

33855
21:24:20,552 --> 21:24:24,512
name in that dictionary this function

33856
21:24:22,960 --> 21:24:27,120
will not throw a key error it's just

33857
21:24:24,512 --> 21:24:29,400
going to return none an O the special V

33858
21:24:27,120 --> 21:24:31,120
the Special Value in Python so it avoids

33859
21:24:29,400 --> 21:24:33,159
a bug in your code but it tightens up

33860
21:24:31,120 --> 21:24:34,720
four lines into one but even nicer if

33861
21:24:33,160 --> 21:24:36,512
you read the documentation

33862
21:24:34,720 --> 21:24:38,600
the get function can also take a

33863
21:24:36,512 --> 21:24:40,760
explicit default value so if you don't

33864
21:24:38,600 --> 21:24:42,360
want none to be on the screen like hello

33865
21:24:40,760 --> 21:24:44,871
comma blank or I mean that would be

33866
21:24:42,360 --> 21:24:46,640
weird too you can just put in a default

33867
21:24:44,872 --> 21:24:49,000
value per the documentation of this

33868
21:24:46,640 --> 21:24:51,552
function like world so now we've gone

33869
21:24:49,000 --> 21:24:53,120
from four lines to just one so arguably

33870
21:24:51,552 --> 21:24:55,280
it's better designed and if I go back to

33871
21:24:53,120 --> 21:24:58,280
the browser now still with Carter in the

33872
21:24:55,280 --> 21:25:02,480
URL and hit reload same thing happens

33873
21:24:58,280 --> 21:25:04,552
but we notice this suppose I uh get rid

33874
21:25:02,480 --> 21:25:07,120
of the name parameter altogether and hit

33875
21:25:04,552 --> 21:25:08,680
enter now it goes to the default instead

33876
21:25:07,120 --> 21:25:10,720
world so it's just a little better a

33877
21:25:08,680 --> 21:25:13,231
little better designed than doing it the

33878
21:25:10,720 --> 21:25:15,680
other way instead all right how about we

33879
21:25:13,232 --> 21:25:18,680
take things up one more Notch and how

33880
21:25:15,680 --> 21:25:20,871
about we introduce multiple routes and

33881
21:25:18,680 --> 21:25:23,480
actually introduce perhaps a form to the

33882
21:25:20,872 --> 21:25:25,640
mix because again no normal person is

33883
21:25:23,480 --> 21:25:27,400
going to like visit a URL and add a

33884
21:25:25,640 --> 21:25:29,552
slash and a question mark and their name

33885
21:25:27,400 --> 21:25:30,959
like that's not how browsers work uh

33886
21:25:29,552 --> 21:25:32,920
well that's how browsers work that's not

33887
21:25:30,960 --> 21:25:35,480
how humans interact with browsers you

33888
21:25:32,920 --> 21:25:36,680
and I use a form to quickly instead so

33889
21:25:35,480 --> 21:25:38,720
now things can get a little more

33890
21:25:36,680 --> 21:25:40,920
interesting when making our own web

33891
21:25:38,720 --> 21:25:43,320
application cuz maybe we could do

33892
21:25:40,920 --> 21:25:46,640
something like this let me go and zoom

33893
21:25:43,320 --> 21:25:48,552
out again let me go back to my code here

33894
21:25:46,640 --> 21:25:51,760
and let me move this around and focus

33895
21:25:48,552 --> 21:25:53,872
now on the index.html file instead of

33896
21:25:51,760 --> 21:25:55,760
just this placeholder why don't we go

33897
21:25:53,872 --> 21:25:57,480
ahead and give ourselves a form like

33898
21:25:55,760 --> 21:25:59,871
we've played with a little bit in the

33899
21:25:57,480 --> 21:26:03,120
past be it for Google or something else

33900
21:25:59,872 --> 21:26:05,512
and let's do this uh form and inside of

33901
21:26:03,120 --> 21:26:07,552
this form let's have an input and the

33902
21:26:05,512 --> 21:26:10,512
name of this input will be quote unquote

33903
21:26:07,552 --> 21:26:12,640
name so that too is confusing but inputs

33904
21:26:10,512 --> 21:26:14,640
have name attributes but this is a

33905
21:26:12,640 --> 21:26:17,280
person's name so I'm saying name equals

33906
21:26:14,640 --> 21:26:19,440
name here so just a messy world of

33907
21:26:17,280 --> 21:26:22,360
semantics and let me go ahead and make

33908
21:26:19,440 --> 21:26:24,512
this a text box by default and then let

33909
21:26:22,360 --> 21:26:27,400
me give myself a button whose default

33910
21:26:24,512 --> 21:26:29,872
type will be submit and the name of this

33911
21:26:27,400 --> 21:26:31,280
button will be greet for instance so

33912
21:26:29,872 --> 21:26:33,120
let's see what happens here but let me

33913
21:26:31,280 --> 21:26:34,552
change app.py to just be the original

33914
21:26:33,120 --> 21:26:36,360
simpler I'm not passing in any

33915
21:26:34,552 --> 21:26:37,760
placeholders now and I'm going to even

33916
21:26:36,360 --> 21:26:39,080
get rid of this I'm just going to rewind

33917
21:26:37,760 --> 21:26:42,231
to the first version of this for

33918
21:26:39,080 --> 21:26:44,192
Simplicity let's now change the url to

33919
21:26:42,232 --> 21:26:46,600
get rid of Carter and myself so we just

33920
21:26:44,192 --> 21:26:49,159
go to slash and hit enter and now we

33921
21:26:46,600 --> 21:26:50,872
have a super simple form again all right

33922
21:26:49,160 --> 21:26:52,480
this is not super userfriendly but

33923
21:26:50,872 --> 21:26:54,800
there's some nice enhancements we can

33924
21:26:52,480 --> 21:26:56,599
make for instance like we can uh for

33925
21:26:54,800 --> 21:26:58,120
instance turn off autocomplete

33926
21:26:56,600 --> 21:26:59,360
especially if I want to type David and

33927
21:26:58,120 --> 21:27:01,440
Carter manually and I don't want it

33928
21:26:59,360 --> 21:27:03,600
finishing my thought during class uh we

33929
21:27:01,440 --> 21:27:05,192
can do autofocus which puts the cursor

33930
21:27:03,600 --> 21:27:06,552
there BL linking by default which is

33931
21:27:05,192 --> 21:27:08,192
nice cuz then the human doesn't have to

33932
21:27:06,552 --> 21:27:10,872
deal with that um and then we can even

33933
21:27:08,192 --> 21:27:12,760
have a placeholder attribute placeholder

33934
21:27:10,872 --> 21:27:14,440
equals name so that it's like built in

33935
21:27:12,760 --> 21:27:16,799
instructions for this thing and so now

33936
21:27:14,440 --> 21:27:18,160
if I go back to the other tab nothing's

33937
21:27:16,800 --> 21:27:20,832
changed yet because I have to download

33938
21:27:18,160 --> 21:27:22,360
the HTML again reload okay now it's a

33939
21:27:20,832 --> 21:27:24,720
little more user friendly it says name

33940
21:27:22,360 --> 21:27:26,552
and light gray the cursor is blinking

33941
21:27:24,720 --> 21:27:29,120
and I'm sort of ready to go but this

33942
21:27:26,552 --> 21:27:31,640
form hasn't been wired up to go anywhere

33943
21:27:29,120 --> 21:27:33,640
yet and so let's do this let's for

33944
21:27:31,640 --> 21:27:34,760
instance say that the action of this

33945
21:27:33,640 --> 21:27:35,760
form

33946
21:27:34,760 --> 21:27:37,552
is not going to be something like

33947
21:27:35,760 --> 21:27:40,080
google.com which we did last time with

33948
21:27:37,552 --> 21:27:42,800
for cats I am now going to be both the

33949
21:27:40,080 --> 21:27:44,360
front end and the back end of this

33950
21:27:42,800 --> 21:27:46,720
website the front end is what the human

33951
21:27:44,360 --> 21:27:48,280
sees the web page the graphics the forms

33952
21:27:46,720 --> 21:27:49,960
the back end is the stuff the human

33953
21:27:48,280 --> 21:27:53,000
typically doesn't see the python code

33954
21:27:49,960 --> 21:27:55,120
the SQL code the server itself but now

33955
21:27:53,000 --> 21:27:58,232
I'm in control of both sides of the

33956
21:27:55,120 --> 21:28:00,480
experience the HTML and also the routes

33957
21:27:58,232 --> 21:28:02,640
so let's just propose that we invent our

33958
21:28:00,480 --> 21:28:04,680
own route and instead of calling it SL

33959
21:28:02,640 --> 21:28:07,440
search like Google does let's call it

33960
21:28:04,680 --> 21:28:09,192
SLG greet and let me specify that the

33961
21:28:07,440 --> 21:28:11,480
method this form will use which is

33962
21:28:09,192 --> 21:28:13,680
technically the default will be get and

33963
21:28:11,480 --> 21:28:15,319
confusingly it is lowercase get even

33964
21:28:13,680 --> 21:28:17,359
though in the envelope we keep talking

33965
21:28:15,320 --> 21:28:18,960
about virtually it's actually capitals

33966
21:28:17,360 --> 21:28:21,280
again left hand wasn't talking to right

33967
21:28:18,960 --> 21:28:23,600
hand when these things were decided all

33968
21:28:21,280 --> 21:28:26,120
right so all I've done is create a web

33969
21:28:23,600 --> 21:28:29,040
form that's going to submit whatever the

33970
21:28:26,120 --> 21:28:31,360
text box value is to a route called SLG

33971
21:28:29,040 --> 21:28:35,120
greet by default because there's no HTTP

33972
21:28:31,360 --> 21:28:36,400
or htps or no domain name SLG greet is

33973
21:28:35,120 --> 21:28:38,920
going to be assumed to be not at

33974
21:28:36,400 --> 21:28:42,159
google.com but whatever my own serers

33975
21:28:38,920 --> 21:28:44,440
URL is so whatever my code spaces URL is

33976
21:28:42,160 --> 21:28:47,320
that's going to be the implicit prefix

33977
21:28:44,440 --> 21:28:51,400
this SLG greet is just the route so now

33978
21:28:47,320 --> 21:28:54,192
let's go back to VSS codes app.py file

33979
21:28:51,400 --> 21:28:56,400
how do I now Stitch this together well I

33980
21:28:54,192 --> 21:28:58,480
think we're good to go with index.html

33981
21:28:56,400 --> 21:29:00,920
if index. html's purpose in life is just

33982
21:28:58,480 --> 21:29:03,192
to spit out this form we're done with

33983
21:29:00,920 --> 21:29:06,440
one of my routes but if I want to have a

33984
21:29:03,192 --> 21:29:09,680
second route greet that actually spits

33985
21:29:06,440 --> 21:29:11,512
out some greeting to the user well let's

33986
21:29:09,680 --> 21:29:14,040
prepare that template too let me go

33987
21:29:11,512 --> 21:29:16,872
ahead and highlight all of this HTML let

33988
21:29:14,040 --> 21:29:20,439
me go back into my terminal window and

33989
21:29:16,872 --> 21:29:22,552
into my hello directory and then into my

33990
21:29:20,440 --> 21:29:25,800
templates directory and let me create

33991
21:29:22,552 --> 21:29:27,360
another template called greet HTML whose

33992
21:29:25,800 --> 21:29:29,832
purpose in life will not be to show a

33993
21:29:27,360 --> 21:29:32,280
form but to greet the user with hello so

33994
21:29:29,832 --> 21:29:34,319
and so so in this file I'm going to

33995
21:29:32,280 --> 21:29:36,160
paste all that same HTML but I'm going

33996
21:29:34,320 --> 21:29:38,232
to get rid of the form and essentially

33997
21:29:36,160 --> 21:29:41,192
revert to our previous version hello

33998
21:29:38,232 --> 21:29:44,512
comma and then using the ginger syntax

33999
21:29:41,192 --> 21:29:46,640
name so one template index.html is for

34000
21:29:44,512 --> 21:29:49,080
the form the second template now is for

34001
21:29:46,640 --> 21:29:51,232
the greeting of hello comma so and so

34002
21:29:49,080 --> 21:29:54,480
but otherwise these files notice are

34003
21:29:51,232 --> 21:29:56,600
almost the same except one has the form

34004
21:29:54,480 --> 21:29:58,720
one has just the hello so now let's

34005
21:29:56,600 --> 21:30:00,440
finish this up in app doop High let me

34006
21:29:58,720 --> 21:30:03,720
go down here after a couple of blank

34007
21:30:00,440 --> 21:30:06,600
lines stylistically let me do app. route

34008
21:30:03,720 --> 21:30:07,960
quote unquote SLG greet but I could call

34009
21:30:06,600 --> 21:30:10,192
this route anything I want I'm just

34010
21:30:07,960 --> 21:30:11,720
using a a reasonable verb then let's

34011
21:30:10,192 --> 21:30:13,920
define another function I could call the

34012
21:30:11,720 --> 21:30:16,120
function anything I want X Y or Z I'm

34013
21:30:13,920 --> 21:30:18,512
going to call it more reasonably greet

34014
21:30:16,120 --> 21:30:20,080
no arguments and then now is the code

34015
21:30:18,512 --> 21:30:25,160
where I want to render the template so I

34016
21:30:20,080 --> 21:30:27,480
do return render template greet HTML but

34017
21:30:25,160 --> 21:30:29,872
but I need to do one more

34018
21:30:27,480 --> 21:30:31,800
thing what else do I want to do if I

34019
21:30:29,872 --> 21:30:35,080
want greet HTML to have access to the

34020
21:30:31,800 --> 21:30:37,440
human's name just to

34021
21:30:35,080 --> 21:30:41,000
recap I think we solved this already but

34022
21:30:37,440 --> 21:30:42,800
I deleted it but what do I have to add

34023
21:30:41,000 --> 21:30:45,232
back

34024
21:30:42,800 --> 21:30:47,400
yeahh yeah so I got to pass in the

34025
21:30:45,232 --> 21:30:48,920
placeholder somehow so I can do this a

34026
21:30:47,400 --> 21:30:50,439
couple of different ways I I'm going to

34027
21:30:48,920 --> 21:30:53,192
keep it a little more elegant this time

34028
21:30:50,440 --> 21:30:55,040
I'm just going to put my name uh

34029
21:30:53,192 --> 21:30:58,832
argument there and I'm going to set it

34030
21:30:55,040 --> 21:31:01,159
equal to request. ar. get quote unquote

34031
21:30:58,832 --> 21:31:02,920
name comma world before I used a

34032
21:31:01,160 --> 21:31:04,400
separate variable but I only used it in

34033
21:31:02,920 --> 21:31:06,440
one place so that's not strictly

34034
21:31:04,400 --> 21:31:08,552
necessary so this is fine too but if

34035
21:31:06,440 --> 21:31:10,680
this gets a little overwhelming notice

34036
21:31:08,552 --> 21:31:13,192
that I can alternatively do this I can

34037
21:31:10,680 --> 21:31:16,400
create an actual variable called name

34038
21:31:13,192 --> 21:31:18,760
and then I can pass in an argument

34039
21:31:16,400 --> 21:31:21,079
called name with a value that is that

34040
21:31:18,760 --> 21:31:22,680
variable but again what's really the

34041
21:31:21,080 --> 21:31:24,512
point here it was kind of prettier all

34042
21:31:22,680 --> 21:31:25,799
on one line so these are the exact same

34043
21:31:24,512 --> 21:31:28,552
things I'm just trying to tighten things

34044
21:31:25,800 --> 21:31:30,832
up further here all right so what just

34045
21:31:28,552 --> 21:31:33,280
happened if I go back to my form this is

34046
21:31:30,832 --> 21:31:35,959
still index.html if I reload it nothing

34047
21:31:33,280 --> 21:31:38,680
has changed if I type in my name to this

34048
21:31:35,960 --> 21:31:40,760
form notice again the URL I'm currently

34049
21:31:38,680 --> 21:31:42,719
at this is Chrome hiding things it's

34050
21:31:40,760 --> 21:31:44,319
technically slash by default even though

34051
21:31:42,720 --> 21:31:47,040
many browsers are just hiding

34052
21:31:44,320 --> 21:31:49,440
unnecessary uh characters these days but

34053
21:31:47,040 --> 21:31:52,760
Watch What Happens now if I scroll over

34054
21:31:49,440 --> 21:31:57,192
here and I click greet on this new

34055
21:31:52,760 --> 21:32:00,599
form notice my URL my route changed to

34056
21:31:57,192 --> 21:32:02,280
SL greet question mark name equals David

34057
21:32:00,600 --> 21:32:04,400
and the body of the page at top left

34058
21:32:02,280 --> 21:32:06,000
says hello comma David so this is

34059
21:32:04,400 --> 21:32:07,959
exactly how google.com works and it's

34060
21:32:06,000 --> 21:32:10,832
how we implemented search. HTML last

34061
21:32:07,960 --> 21:32:13,872
time but instead of submitting the form

34062
21:32:10,832 --> 21:32:16,040
to Google via the form I'm submitting it

34063
21:32:13,872 --> 21:32:18,720
to myself my very own route so I'm

34064
21:32:16,040 --> 21:32:21,959
implementing my own backend for this

34065
21:32:18,720 --> 21:32:24,160
same front end all right any questions

34066
21:32:21,960 --> 21:32:26,400
just yet much less interesting than

34067
21:32:24,160 --> 21:32:29,400
Google certainly but we kind of have all

34068
21:32:26,400 --> 21:32:31,920
of the wiring

34069
21:32:29,400 --> 21:32:34,400
now any

34070
21:32:31,920 --> 21:32:37,920
questions no

34071
21:32:34,400 --> 21:32:39,871
all right so what can we do to further

34072
21:32:37,920 --> 21:32:42,760
uh tighten this up and adhere to some

34073
21:32:39,872 --> 21:32:45,440
conventions well let me propose that in

34074
21:32:42,760 --> 21:32:46,832
this version we solve one problem and

34075
21:32:45,440 --> 21:32:48,320
even if you've never done this sort of

34076
21:32:46,832 --> 21:32:50,439
thing before I dare say we have enough

34077
21:32:48,320 --> 21:32:54,680
weeks of cs-50 where if I show you

34078
21:32:50,440 --> 21:32:58,360
index.html again and greet HTML again

34079
21:32:54,680 --> 21:33:00,319
odds are to someone's mind there's a

34080
21:32:58,360 --> 21:33:03,000
opportunity for

34081
21:33:00,320 --> 21:33:05,400
improvement why is this web app super

34082
21:33:03,000 --> 21:33:07,960
simple though it is arguably poorly

34083
21:33:05,400 --> 21:33:10,871
designed at the

34084
21:33:07,960 --> 21:33:13,280
moment and the answer lies somewhere in

34085
21:33:10,872 --> 21:33:15,960
these two templates index.html and

34086
21:33:13,280 --> 21:33:15,959
greet.tolowercase

34087
21:33:33,512 --> 21:33:37,832
probably did necessarily for your

34088
21:33:35,720 --> 21:33:40,232
homepage why because when you have HTML

34089
21:33:37,832 --> 21:33:42,599
only maybe CSS and even JavaScript

34090
21:33:40,232 --> 21:33:44,480
that's all you can do is copy paste copy

34091
21:33:42,600 --> 21:33:45,872
paste and just make sure that you have

34092
21:33:44,480 --> 21:33:47,920
the same structure maybe you have the

34093
21:33:45,872 --> 21:33:49,512
same CSS file the same Javascript file

34094
21:33:47,920 --> 21:33:51,280
the same third party libraries but it

34095
21:33:49,512 --> 21:33:53,040
makes it very very annoying as you might

34096
21:33:51,280 --> 21:33:55,040
have realized already to just m make a

34097
21:33:53,040 --> 21:33:56,832
change that affects everything so

34098
21:33:55,040 --> 21:34:00,000
wouldn't it be nice to like factor out

34099
21:33:56,832 --> 21:34:02,231
all of this and all of this and just let

34100
21:34:00,000 --> 21:34:04,400
the body change so here too is something

34101
21:34:02,232 --> 21:34:07,000
that flask and really other equivalent

34102
21:34:04,400 --> 21:34:08,120
Frameworks let us do it allows us to

34103
21:34:07,000 --> 21:34:10,720
create what we're going to call

34104
21:34:08,120 --> 21:34:11,920
conventionally a layout instead so I'm

34105
21:34:10,720 --> 21:34:14,600
going to go ahead and do this I'm going

34106
21:34:11,920 --> 21:34:17,599
to copy one last time all of the same

34107
21:34:14,600 --> 21:34:19,360
HTML I'm going to go into uh my terminal

34108
21:34:17,600 --> 21:34:22,640
window and I'm going to create by

34109
21:34:19,360 --> 21:34:24,600
convention a file called layout. HTML

34110
21:34:22,640 --> 21:34:27,232
this is truly going to be a blueprint of

34111
21:34:24,600 --> 21:34:29,232
sorts and in layout. HTML I'm going to

34112
21:34:27,232 --> 21:34:32,512
paste all of that same code but I'm

34113
21:34:29,232 --> 21:34:34,800
going to use now some ginger syntax to

34114
21:34:32,512 --> 21:34:37,760
indicate that I don't want to plug in

34115
21:34:34,800 --> 21:34:39,960
just a variable like name here I want to

34116
21:34:37,760 --> 21:34:42,192
actually plug the contents of a whole

34117
21:34:39,960 --> 21:34:44,760
other file so instead of just using

34118
21:34:42,192 --> 21:34:46,440
curly braces two of them left and right

34119
21:34:44,760 --> 21:34:49,159
I have to use slightly different syntax

34120
21:34:46,440 --> 21:34:51,480
to say I want a whole block of HTML here

34121
21:34:49,160 --> 21:34:53,280
from some other file and the way to do

34122
21:34:51,480 --> 21:34:56,280
this even though the syntax is a little

34123
21:34:53,280 --> 21:34:59,720
non-obvious is you use open curly brace

34124
21:34:56,280 --> 21:35:01,512
percent sign block then you can call the

34125
21:34:59,720 --> 21:35:03,440
next word anything you want it just has

34126
21:35:01,512 --> 21:35:06,280
to be a special type of placeholder for

34127
21:35:03,440 --> 21:35:07,960
an actual file not for just a variable

34128
21:35:06,280 --> 21:35:09,552
I'm going to call it body only because

34129
21:35:07,960 --> 21:35:11,720
I'm in the body so I'm want a

34130
21:35:09,552 --> 21:35:13,832
placeholder to be the entire body and

34131
21:35:11,720 --> 21:35:17,320
then outside of this you then say in one

34132
21:35:13,832 --> 21:35:19,040
word no space end block so it looks kind

34133
21:35:17,320 --> 21:35:20,760
of stupid honestly and why do we have

34134
21:35:19,040 --> 21:35:22,511
yet more ugly syntax again just

34135
21:35:20,760 --> 21:35:24,040
different software developers in the

34136
21:35:22,512 --> 21:35:25,832
world are all choosing their own Syntax

34137
21:35:24,040 --> 21:35:27,000
for their own libraries so they all kind

34138
21:35:25,832 --> 21:35:28,720
of look different but are all kind of

34139
21:35:27,000 --> 21:35:31,440
similar in spirit and you just get used

34140
21:35:28,720 --> 21:35:34,040
to seeing the different syntax this now

34141
21:35:31,440 --> 21:35:36,440
is not nearly as pretty as the pair of

34142
21:35:34,040 --> 21:35:38,319
curly braces for variables but this is

34143
21:35:36,440 --> 21:35:41,160
how I can say plug the contents of an

34144
21:35:38,320 --> 21:35:45,832
entire file Here and Now what does this

34145
21:35:41,160 --> 21:35:48,320
let me do I can now go back into my

34146
21:35:45,832 --> 21:35:50,120
index.html file which at the moment

34147
21:35:48,320 --> 21:35:52,552
still looks like this but almost all of

34148
21:35:50,120 --> 21:35:55,231
this is copy paste the only lines that

34149
21:35:52,552 --> 21:35:57,920
are interesting and different are these

34150
21:35:55,232 --> 21:35:59,600
four lines here in the body so what I

34151
21:35:57,920 --> 21:36:01,232
can actually do now is I'm going to

34152
21:35:59,600 --> 21:36:02,320
highlight that and cut it and then I'm

34153
21:36:01,232 --> 21:36:04,360
going to highlight everything else and

34154
21:36:02,320 --> 21:36:06,400
just delete the entire file and I'm

34155
21:36:04,360 --> 21:36:10,680
going to use some of that same syntax

34156
21:36:06,400 --> 21:36:14,439
and say curly brace percent sign extends

34157
21:36:10,680 --> 21:36:16,439
quote unquote layout. HTML and then I

34158
21:36:14,440 --> 21:36:19,160
close my thought with a percent sign and

34159
21:36:16,440 --> 21:36:21,680
close curly brace so this syntax as you

34160
21:36:19,160 --> 21:36:25,040
might just be inferring is now saying

34161
21:36:21,680 --> 21:36:27,280
please extend whatever layout. HTML

34162
21:36:25,040 --> 21:36:28,920
looks like that's the original blueprint

34163
21:36:27,280 --> 21:36:31,600
the mold out of which I want to make

34164
21:36:28,920 --> 21:36:33,512
this web page and now here the syntax is

34165
21:36:31,600 --> 21:36:36,320
a little weird too but similar at least

34166
21:36:33,512 --> 21:36:38,832
from before I can now say the block the

34167
21:36:36,320 --> 21:36:42,600
body block that I want you to plug into

34168
21:36:38,832 --> 21:36:45,000
that layout is going to be everything

34169
21:36:42,600 --> 21:36:48,232
between these two tags which we already

34170
21:36:45,000 --> 21:36:50,720
saw earlier but in layout. HTML they're

34171
21:36:48,232 --> 21:36:52,600
sort of giving a placeholder in

34172
21:36:50,720 --> 21:36:54,832
index.html this is what I'm going to

34173
21:36:52,600 --> 21:36:56,232
plug in to those other placeholders as

34174
21:36:54,832 --> 21:36:58,080
well so I'm just going to give myself

34175
21:36:56,232 --> 21:37:00,360
some extra white space I'm going to

34176
21:36:58,080 --> 21:37:01,920
paste the HTML that was there if I want

34177
21:37:00,360 --> 21:37:03,320
to make clear what's going on I can

34178
21:37:01,920 --> 21:37:05,040
indent it although this has no no

34179
21:37:03,320 --> 21:37:06,872
functional impact but it just makes

34180
21:37:05,040 --> 21:37:09,511
clear that just like in HTML you can

34181
21:37:06,872 --> 21:37:12,872
open a ginger tag and close it but in

34182
21:37:09,512 --> 21:37:15,232
ginger here we have this here hey uh Hey

34183
21:37:12,872 --> 21:37:17,280
python here comes the body of this page

34184
21:37:15,232 --> 21:37:19,280
hey python that's it for the body of

34185
21:37:17,280 --> 21:37:23,512
this page and all of this stuff should

34186
21:37:19,280 --> 21:37:26,480
be plugged into this main parent layout

34187
21:37:23,512 --> 21:37:28,120
if you will so super ugly admittedly but

34188
21:37:26,480 --> 21:37:29,440
now at least things get way less

34189
21:37:28,120 --> 21:37:32,480
redundant because I'm going to do the

34190
21:37:29,440 --> 21:37:34,400
exact same thing over here in greet HTML

34191
21:37:32,480 --> 21:37:39,159
it looks like this but now I'm going to

34192
21:37:34,400 --> 21:37:42,400
do this extends layout. HTML also just

34193
21:37:39,160 --> 21:37:43,960
as before uh the body the uh the body

34194
21:37:42,400 --> 21:37:47,159
that I want to plug in is going to be

34195
21:37:43,960 --> 21:37:48,832
everything inside of these tags here and

34196
21:37:47,160 --> 21:37:53,280
this body is just going to be hello

34197
21:37:48,832 --> 21:37:55,799
comma name in curly braces like that so

34198
21:37:53,280 --> 21:37:57,800
again ugly syntax got really ugly fast

34199
21:37:55,800 --> 21:37:59,232
but it's really just following these

34200
21:37:57,800 --> 21:38:01,192
patterns now and we have two types of

34201
21:37:59,232 --> 21:38:04,280
placeholders two curly braces for

34202
21:38:01,192 --> 21:38:06,040
variables and now this kind of syntax

34203
21:38:04,280 --> 21:38:08,720
with the percent signs and the single

34204
21:38:06,040 --> 21:38:12,231
curly braces for like contents of actual

34205
21:38:08,720 --> 21:38:13,920
files and so now in this world or in the

34206
21:38:12,232 --> 21:38:15,920
world of a homepage if you were using

34207
21:38:13,920 --> 21:38:18,192
flask and python to make your personal

34208
21:38:15,920 --> 21:38:19,959
homepage with all of those various Pages

34209
21:38:18,192 --> 21:38:21,871
you would probably design one main

34210
21:38:19,960 --> 21:38:23,760
layout with all of your pretty logos and

34211
21:38:21,872 --> 21:38:25,400
colors and fonts and like what you want

34212
21:38:23,760 --> 21:38:27,319
the site to look like and then each of

34213
21:38:25,400 --> 21:38:29,439
your smaller Pages would now be

34214
21:38:27,320 --> 21:38:31,232
distilled into just these smaller

34215
21:38:29,440 --> 21:38:33,600
fragments and whether you're using

34216
21:38:31,232 --> 21:38:35,360
python or Java or Javas script or other

34217
21:38:33,600 --> 21:38:37,280
languages too all different programming

34218
21:38:35,360 --> 21:38:40,040
languages have popular Frameworks that

34219
21:38:37,280 --> 21:38:42,160
do things like this the idea is the same

34220
21:38:40,040 --> 21:38:43,719
across all of them all right let's see

34221
21:38:42,160 --> 21:38:47,680
if it works let's go back into the

34222
21:38:43,720 --> 21:38:49,760
browser let me go back to my slash route

34223
21:38:47,680 --> 21:38:52,511
there's that same form let me type in

34224
21:38:49,760 --> 21:38:55,040
David and type and click greet and

34225
21:38:52,512 --> 21:38:57,000
indeed I see hello comma David I see

34226
21:38:55,040 --> 21:38:58,799
that greet was automatically added to

34227
21:38:57,000 --> 21:39:00,960
the URL by the browser when I submitted

34228
21:38:58,800 --> 21:39:02,960
the form followed by the key value Pairs

34229
21:39:00,960 --> 21:39:04,960
and if I view the page source as I did

34230
21:39:02,960 --> 21:39:08,120
earlier you'll see that you have the

34231
21:39:04,960 --> 21:39:10,192
entirety of that layout with hello David

34232
21:39:08,120 --> 21:39:13,319
plugged in meanwhile if I go back to the

34233
21:39:10,192 --> 21:39:15,552
form and view this page Source you'll

34234
21:39:13,320 --> 21:39:17,872
see the exact same layout but with the

34235
21:39:15,552 --> 21:39:20,360
form tag plugged in and here's where you

34236
21:39:17,872 --> 21:39:22,600
can be a little less uh nitpicky with

34237
21:39:20,360 --> 21:39:24,600
styling okay yes this isn't technically

34238
21:39:22,600 --> 21:39:26,360
indented inside of the body but it was

34239
21:39:24,600 --> 21:39:28,040
relative to the original file so at this

34240
21:39:26,360 --> 21:39:30,232
point in the game you don't need to

34241
21:39:28,040 --> 21:39:32,400
worry about your outputed HTML looking

34242
21:39:30,232 --> 21:39:34,760
super pretty you want your source code

34243
21:39:32,400 --> 21:39:37,040
that the see to be pretty not the

34244
21:39:34,760 --> 21:39:40,360
browser this is not a stylistic

34245
21:39:37,040 --> 21:39:42,920
concern okay questions on these

34246
21:39:40,360 --> 21:39:45,832
capabilities then a

34247
21:39:42,920 --> 21:39:48,920
flask or problems that we've just solved

34248
21:39:45,832 --> 21:39:48,920
and why

34249
21:39:51,600 --> 21:39:57,440
yeah uh okay so if the files in question

34250
21:39:54,800 --> 21:40:01,000
are in different folders for instance if

34251
21:39:57,440 --> 21:40:05,320
I go back into my uh index page which

34252
21:40:01,000 --> 21:40:08,360
has the form um the routes here are

34253
21:40:05,320 --> 21:40:11,000
entirely dependent on what is an app.py

34254
21:40:08,360 --> 21:40:12,960
there's no notion of a folder when it

34255
21:40:11,000 --> 21:40:15,320
comes to implementing a web application

34256
21:40:12,960 --> 21:40:17,320
anymore they are more generically routes

34257
21:40:15,320 --> 21:40:19,640
however and we've not done this yet you

34258
21:40:17,320 --> 21:40:21,552
can put your static content your images

34259
21:40:19,640 --> 21:40:23,232
your video files your CSS files in a

34260
21:40:21,552 --> 21:40:25,959
folder called Static and there can be

34261
21:40:23,232 --> 21:40:27,960
subfolders therein and that would affect

34262
21:40:25,960 --> 21:40:30,640
what you use as your Source attributes

34263
21:40:27,960 --> 21:40:33,920
for images or your Source uh tags for

34264
21:40:30,640 --> 21:40:35,232
video or any of those kinds of assets

34265
21:40:33,920 --> 21:40:37,680
and we'll see that eventually in the

34266
21:40:35,232 --> 21:40:39,640
home in the uh the problem set next

34267
21:40:37,680 --> 21:40:41,640
other questions on what we've just done

34268
21:40:39,640 --> 21:40:44,000
here

34269
21:40:41,640 --> 21:40:46,192
yeah good question how do I how did I

34270
21:40:44,000 --> 21:40:49,640
ensure that the web app starts on the

34271
21:40:46,192 --> 21:40:52,832
form and then goes to the hello page so

34272
21:40:49,640 --> 21:40:55,552
whatever you decide your default index

34273
21:40:52,832 --> 21:40:57,120
route is like the implicit slash that is

34274
21:40:55,552 --> 21:40:59,512
what is going to be pulled up when a

34275
21:40:57,120 --> 21:41:01,871
user visits the domain name where your

34276
21:40:59,512 --> 21:41:05,512
website is hosted so if I go back over

34277
21:41:01,872 --> 21:41:08,120
here to app Pi because my slash route is

34278
21:41:05,512 --> 21:41:11,680
designed to return index.html that's

34279
21:41:08,120 --> 21:41:14,360
exactly why that response came back good

34280
21:41:11,680 --> 21:41:16,231
question all right so beyond this let's

34281
21:41:14,360 --> 21:41:17,720
consider now issues of privacy and we'll

34282
21:41:16,232 --> 21:41:19,480
touch on this too as we get to issues

34283
21:41:17,720 --> 21:41:21,920
like shopping carts and cookies if I

34284
21:41:19,480 --> 21:41:23,959
zoom in on the URL here even though the

34285
21:41:21,920 --> 21:41:26,760
URL itself is a little long and ugly and

34286
21:41:23,960 --> 21:41:30,480
cryptic but when I type in my name and

34287
21:41:26,760 --> 21:41:33,360
hit uh greet of course we keep seeing

34288
21:41:30,480 --> 21:41:35,959
name equals David in the URL in what

34289
21:41:33,360 --> 21:41:39,600
sense might this be bad

34290
21:41:35,960 --> 21:41:41,680
design or in what kinds of web apps

34291
21:41:39,600 --> 21:41:43,280
might you not want the name to show up

34292
21:41:41,680 --> 21:41:46,231
in the URL like that because this is

34293
21:41:43,280 --> 21:41:47,800
what Google does this is what my app

34294
21:41:46,232 --> 21:41:50,040
does

34295
21:41:47,800 --> 21:41:52,600
yeah yeah so if I'm logging in with a

34296
21:41:50,040 --> 21:41:54,511
username and password I I could imagine

34297
21:41:52,600 --> 21:41:56,720
that they show up in the URL after the

34298
21:41:54,512 --> 21:41:59,720
question mark where username equals

34299
21:41:56,720 --> 21:42:01,872
mailin and password equals 1 2 3 4 5 but

34300
21:41:59,720 --> 21:42:02,920
then all my you know like nosy siblings

34301
21:42:01,872 --> 21:42:04,920
need to do is go through through my

34302
21:42:02,920 --> 21:42:06,872
browser history and boom like it's right

34303
21:42:04,920 --> 21:42:08,832
there for them to copy paste so that

34304
21:42:06,872 --> 21:42:11,000
doesn't seem particularly uh secure or

34305
21:42:08,832 --> 21:42:12,920
if someone's walking past you in a cafe

34306
21:42:11,000 --> 21:42:14,800
they can just look at your url if it's

34307
21:42:12,920 --> 21:42:17,440
revealed by the browser and they see it

34308
21:42:14,800 --> 21:42:19,400
too so get is not necessarily the best

34309
21:42:17,440 --> 21:42:21,512
verb to use even though it's the default

34310
21:42:19,400 --> 21:42:23,192
when submitting forms typically when

34311
21:42:21,512 --> 21:42:25,760
you've got anything remotely sensitive

34312
21:42:23,192 --> 21:42:28,552
or anything large so be it a password or

34313
21:42:25,760 --> 21:42:30,599
credit card number or like an image or a

34314
21:42:28,552 --> 21:42:33,192
video that you're uploading to uh

34315
21:42:30,600 --> 21:42:35,480
Instagram or to YouTube or any such site

34316
21:42:33,192 --> 21:42:38,400
like that you don't want the data going

34317
21:42:35,480 --> 21:42:40,480
into the URL and thankfully there's

34318
21:42:38,400 --> 21:42:43,159
actually an easy way to fix this I can

34319
21:42:40,480 --> 21:42:45,192
go into my form which is currently in

34320
21:42:43,160 --> 21:42:48,480
index.html and I can just change the

34321
21:42:45,192 --> 21:42:50,400
method from get to post in lower case

34322
21:42:48,480 --> 21:42:51,920
here but the verb in the virtual

34323
21:42:50,400 --> 21:42:55,231
envelope we discussed last week would

34324
21:42:51,920 --> 21:42:58,120
itself be capital p o St now

34325
21:42:55,232 --> 21:43:01,360
unfortunately Watch What Happens here

34326
21:42:58,120 --> 21:43:03,480
let me go over to my original form by

34327
21:43:01,360 --> 21:43:04,920
going back to the Slash rout and I'm

34328
21:43:03,480 --> 21:43:07,920
reloading the page to make sure I get

34329
21:43:04,920 --> 21:43:11,160
the latest freshest HTML and just as a

34330
21:43:07,920 --> 21:43:13,920
um just to confirm here yep if I view

34331
21:43:11,160 --> 21:43:15,800
Source method is now post so let me go

34332
21:43:13,920 --> 21:43:18,440
ahead and type in David now and click

34333
21:43:15,800 --> 21:43:20,720
greet and before we saw hello David but

34334
21:43:18,440 --> 21:43:23,080
now I get method not allowed and this is

34335
21:43:20,720 --> 21:43:26,232
somewhat subtle but in the title of the

34336
21:43:23,080 --> 21:43:28,000
tab notice that it's a 405 error which

34337
21:43:26,232 --> 21:43:30,640
is not familiar probably almost all of

34338
21:43:28,000 --> 21:43:33,920
us have seen 404 file not found turns

34339
21:43:30,640 --> 21:43:36,960
out 405 a little more Arcane is the

34340
21:43:33,920 --> 21:43:39,120
method the HTTP verb is not allowed why

34341
21:43:36,960 --> 21:43:42,552
because by default my app.py only

34342
21:43:39,120 --> 21:43:44,440
currently supports get by default how do

34343
21:43:42,552 --> 21:43:46,872
I support post well I just need a little

34344
21:43:44,440 --> 21:43:50,440
bit more syntax so let me go back into

34345
21:43:46,872 --> 21:43:52,640
vs code here let me go into app.py now

34346
21:43:50,440 --> 21:43:55,080
and after changing the form I just need

34347
21:43:52,640 --> 21:43:57,480
to inform flask that you know what the

34348
21:43:55,080 --> 21:43:59,280
method I want this GRE route to use

34349
21:43:57,480 --> 21:44:02,552
should not be the default which is only

34350
21:43:59,280 --> 21:44:04,600
get I want it to use these methods and

34351
21:44:02,552 --> 21:44:07,159
it takes a second argument called

34352
21:44:04,600 --> 21:44:09,360
Methods the value of which is a list the

34353
21:44:07,160 --> 21:44:11,160
default of which is quote unquote get so

34354
21:44:09,360 --> 21:44:13,360
that's the default this has not made any

34355
21:44:11,160 --> 21:44:16,512
changes but if I want to support post

34356
21:44:13,360 --> 21:44:20,400
instead I can explicitly pass a list

34357
21:44:16,512 --> 21:44:22,192
with one string in it P instead and now

34358
21:44:20,400 --> 21:44:24,511
what does this mean we didn't talk about

34359
21:44:22,192 --> 21:44:26,640
this in any detail last week but inside

34360
21:44:24,512 --> 21:44:30,000
of this virtual envelope typically is

34361
21:44:26,640 --> 21:44:32,760
that line like get slash search Q equals

34362
21:44:30,000 --> 21:44:34,280
cat after the ex after the question mark

34363
21:44:32,760 --> 21:44:35,920
if you want to hide that kind of

34364
21:44:34,280 --> 21:44:37,360
information for privacy sake or because

34365
21:44:35,920 --> 21:44:38,640
you want to upload like an image which

34366
21:44:37,360 --> 21:44:40,872
just doesn't make sense to put in the

34367
21:44:38,640 --> 21:44:43,080
URL essentially the part of the story

34368
21:44:40,872 --> 21:44:44,800
would be well the computer looks deeper

34369
21:44:43,080 --> 21:44:47,360
inside of that virtual envelope and

34370
21:44:44,800 --> 21:44:49,872
anything submitted via post goes below

34371
21:44:47,360 --> 21:44:51,512
the htdp headers like deeper in that

34372
21:44:49,872 --> 21:44:54,120
envelope so they're still there they're

34373
21:44:51,512 --> 21:44:57,160
just not obviously visible uh for prying

34374
21:44:54,120 --> 21:44:59,640
eyes in the user's own browser so just

34375
21:44:57,160 --> 21:45:01,760
by making that change in the HTML

34376
21:44:59,640 --> 21:45:04,232
telling the browser to submit the data

34377
21:45:01,760 --> 21:45:07,439
via post and changing app.py to tell the

34378
21:45:04,232 --> 21:45:10,280
route to expect the data via post I can

34379
21:45:07,440 --> 21:45:12,680
now go back to my other tab let me go

34380
21:45:10,280 --> 21:45:14,440
back to the original page let me reload

34381
21:45:12,680 --> 21:45:16,920
just so I've got the latest HTML and

34382
21:45:14,440 --> 21:45:19,480
indeed view page Source it's still yep

34383
21:45:16,920 --> 21:45:23,319
it's still post but now when I type in

34384
21:45:19,480 --> 21:45:27,192
DAV ID and click greet now it works but

34385
21:45:23,320 --> 21:45:29,280
but but notice the Privacy implication

34386
21:45:27,192 --> 21:45:32,400
I'm at the SLG greet route but where's

34387
21:45:29,280 --> 21:45:34,040
my name it's not actually there it's

34388
21:45:32,400 --> 21:45:36,040
still went to the server but it's not in

34389
21:45:34,040 --> 21:45:40,719
your autocomplete or your history now

34390
21:45:36,040 --> 21:45:44,079
for privacy sake questions now on

34391
21:45:40,720 --> 21:45:46,680
post yeah oh No Just scratching all

34392
21:45:44,080 --> 21:45:47,960
right can you the programmer see this

34393
21:45:46,680 --> 21:45:50,680
well let me show you a couple of other

34394
21:45:47,960 --> 21:45:53,192
features of Chrome's uh Chrome and

34395
21:45:50,680 --> 21:45:54,719
Safari and other browsers as well I keep

34396
21:45:53,192 --> 21:45:56,440
going to view page source which just

34397
21:45:54,720 --> 21:45:58,800
shows you like a readon version of your

34398
21:45:56,440 --> 21:46:00,480
HTML but recall that last time I

34399
21:45:58,800 --> 21:46:02,512
actually right-clicked and went to

34400
21:46:00,480 --> 21:46:04,000
inspect or viewed developer tool tools

34401
21:46:02,512 --> 21:46:06,440
and this brings up a much fancier

34402
21:46:04,000 --> 21:46:08,280
version of the developer tools and under

34403
21:46:06,440 --> 21:46:09,640
elements here you see everything and

34404
21:46:08,280 --> 21:46:11,360
it's nice and pretty printed it's

34405
21:46:09,640 --> 21:46:12,872
hierarchical it collapses things into

34406
21:46:11,360 --> 21:46:14,440
these clickable triangles but it's the

34407
21:46:12,872 --> 21:46:16,440
exact same thing it's just more

34408
21:46:14,440 --> 21:46:19,040
interactive but notice what I can do

34409
21:46:16,440 --> 21:46:21,600
today is this if I go to the network tab

34410
21:46:19,040 --> 21:46:25,360
here and let me zoom out a little bit

34411
21:46:21,600 --> 21:46:29,320
let me go ahead and re uh load the form

34412
21:46:25,360 --> 21:46:33,400
here and type in David again and click

34413
21:46:29,320 --> 21:46:36,080
greet notice now in the network tab of

34414
21:46:33,400 --> 21:46:38,680
Chrome's developer tools I see a few

34415
21:46:36,080 --> 21:46:41,160
things as we saw before one I see that

34416
21:46:38,680 --> 21:46:42,760
the request method is post two I see

34417
21:46:41,160 --> 21:46:44,800
that the server automatically without me

34418
21:46:42,760 --> 21:46:47,000
writing any code for this returns 200

34419
21:46:44,800 --> 21:46:50,000
when it's successful but I can scroll

34420
21:46:47,000 --> 21:46:52,680
down down down down down and you'll see

34421
21:46:50,000 --> 21:46:55,192
that eventually after all these cookies

34422
21:46:52,680 --> 21:46:57,799
more on those later if I click on

34423
21:46:55,192 --> 21:47:00,640
payload the second tab next to headers

34424
21:46:57,800 --> 21:47:02,320
you can see as the developer what was

34425
21:47:00,640 --> 21:47:03,600
actually sent to the server so indeed

34426
21:47:02,320 --> 21:47:05,160
this is going to be super useful like

34427
21:47:03,600 --> 21:47:07,000
when doing problem set 9 maybe your

34428
21:47:05,160 --> 21:47:09,320
final projects if you want to see what's

34429
21:47:07,000 --> 21:47:11,600
going from browser to server you have

34430
21:47:09,320 --> 21:47:13,640
complete control over all of that

34431
21:47:11,600 --> 21:47:14,960
information even if you're using htps

34432
21:47:13,640 --> 21:47:17,440
because your browser and you the

34433
21:47:14,960 --> 21:47:19,360
developer can certainly see all of this

34434
21:47:17,440 --> 21:47:20,640
so again these developer tools even

34435
21:47:19,360 --> 21:47:22,640
though there's a lot of tabs and buttons

34436
21:47:20,640 --> 21:47:24,960
you probably won't need anytime soon

34437
21:47:22,640 --> 21:47:26,832
some of them like elements and network

34438
21:47:24,960 --> 21:47:30,360
and with JavaScript console are going to

34439
21:47:26,832 --> 21:47:35,360
be super useful to start to get familiar

34440
21:47:30,360 --> 21:47:38,920
with all right any questions now on this

34441
21:47:35,360 --> 21:47:42,192
implication of

34442
21:47:38,920 --> 21:47:45,760
post anything at

34443
21:47:42,192 --> 21:47:47,832
all no okay how about one final hello

34444
21:47:45,760 --> 21:47:50,439
example that ties a few of these things

34445
21:47:47,832 --> 21:47:52,920
together how about now we try to tighten

34446
21:47:50,440 --> 21:47:54,512
things up further only in anticipation

34447
21:47:52,920 --> 21:47:57,080
of something like problem set 9 or

34448
21:47:54,512 --> 21:48:00,280
really more complicated web apps where

34449
21:47:57,080 --> 21:48:02,160
you might have not two but 20 or maybe

34450
21:48:00,280 --> 21:48:04,920
even more different routes it might

34451
21:48:02,160 --> 21:48:06,480
might be ideal to just minimize how many

34452
21:48:04,920 --> 21:48:08,512
total routes we have so we don't get a

34453
21:48:06,480 --> 21:48:11,552
little too overwhelmed and I dare say

34454
21:48:08,512 --> 21:48:14,192
that these two routes are so short maybe

34455
21:48:11,552 --> 21:48:16,000
I can combine them into one and maybe I

34456
21:48:14,192 --> 21:48:18,080
can keep the user at what seems to be

34457
21:48:16,000 --> 21:48:20,320
the same URL but just a kind of Tidy

34458
21:48:18,080 --> 21:48:23,600
things up so let me propose that we do

34459
21:48:20,320 --> 21:48:27,760
this instead let me get rid of my greet

34460
21:48:23,600 --> 21:48:30,160
route and let me go into my form in

34461
21:48:27,760 --> 21:48:33,192
index.html and let me go ahead and just

34462
21:48:30,160 --> 21:48:35,400
have the action of this form still slash

34463
21:48:33,192 --> 21:48:37,920
so I want the form to be visible at

34464
21:48:35,400 --> 21:48:40,480
slash the index of the site but I also

34465
21:48:37,920 --> 21:48:42,232
want the form to submit to itself if

34466
21:48:40,480 --> 21:48:44,192
only because I don't want to introduce

34467
21:48:42,232 --> 21:48:45,832
another route like SLG greet which

34468
21:48:44,192 --> 21:48:47,319
eventually indeed will be compelling so

34469
21:48:45,832 --> 21:48:49,511
you don't have one route for everything

34470
21:48:47,320 --> 21:48:51,120
you want your website to do so

34471
21:48:49,512 --> 21:48:53,120
technically this is the default to and

34472
21:48:51,120 --> 21:48:55,120
if I omit action the exact same thing

34473
21:48:53,120 --> 21:48:57,319
would happen as well but let me rewind

34474
21:48:55,120 --> 21:48:59,360
and let me now go into app.py to see how

34475
21:48:57,320 --> 21:49:01,640
we can make this happen well if I want

34476
21:48:59,360 --> 21:49:04,280
my one and now only route to support

34477
21:49:01,640 --> 21:49:07,120
both methods I can say methods equals

34478
21:49:04,280 --> 21:49:08,600
and then a list with both get and post

34479
21:49:07,120 --> 21:49:10,920
in any order but I'll keep them

34480
21:49:08,600 --> 21:49:13,600
alphabetical like this this now tells

34481
21:49:10,920 --> 21:49:17,280
python hey this route should handle both

34482
21:49:13,600 --> 21:49:19,832
get and post requests at the same place

34483
21:49:17,280 --> 21:49:23,280
let's now go into this function I kind

34484
21:49:19,832 --> 21:49:26,760
of want to say the equivalent of this if

34485
21:49:23,280 --> 21:49:29,512
get then I want to return the form else

34486
21:49:26,760 --> 21:49:32,959
if post I want to then return render

34487
21:49:29,512 --> 21:49:35,000
template of greet Doh HTML with the

34488
21:49:32,960 --> 21:49:37,280
user's name but this is not yet complete

34489
21:49:35,000 --> 21:49:39,320
code but I think I can do this I'm going

34490
21:49:37,280 --> 21:49:42,040
to go ahead and say the following I'm

34491
21:49:39,320 --> 21:49:46,040
going to go ahead and say if

34492
21:49:42,040 --> 21:49:47,599
request. method equals equals get then

34493
21:49:46,040 --> 21:49:51,079
indeed return

34494
21:49:47,600 --> 21:49:53,920
index.html L if request. method equals

34495
21:49:51,080 --> 21:49:56,872
equals post then go ahead and return

34496
21:49:53,920 --> 21:49:58,232
greet HTML this isn't quite enough

34497
21:49:56,872 --> 21:50:00,040
though because I still want to pass in

34498
21:49:58,232 --> 21:50:04,280
that placeholder so let me again add

34499
21:50:00,040 --> 21:50:06,680
back name equals request. args doget

34500
21:50:04,280 --> 21:50:10,440
quote unquote name and then a default

34501
21:50:06,680 --> 21:50:13,400
value of world what does this Now do for

34502
21:50:10,440 --> 21:50:15,000
me well let me go back to my other tab

34503
21:50:13,400 --> 21:50:16,599
here let me close the developer tools

34504
21:50:15,000 --> 21:50:18,232
let me go back to the form here let me

34505
21:50:16,600 --> 21:50:19,720
reload to make sure I have the latest

34506
21:50:18,232 --> 21:50:21,360
let me view page Source just to make

34507
21:50:19,720 --> 21:50:23,160
sure I have the latest and yep I have

34508
21:50:21,360 --> 21:50:25,480
the latest because it still says post

34509
21:50:23,160 --> 21:50:27,872
but it now says slash and let's see what

34510
21:50:25,480 --> 21:50:29,920
happens now if I type in my name David

34511
21:50:27,872 --> 21:50:32,160
previously this submitted bya post so I

34512
21:50:29,920 --> 21:50:34,480
didn't see any name or value thereof in

34513
21:50:32,160 --> 21:50:36,360
the URL but I did end up at SLG greet

34514
21:50:34,480 --> 21:50:39,280
but if the action is now slash and I

34515
21:50:36,360 --> 21:50:41,960
click greet notice that it still kind of

34516
21:50:39,280 --> 21:50:43,232
works I see hello comma World although

34517
21:50:41,960 --> 21:50:44,600
that didn't quite work so we'll come

34518
21:50:43,232 --> 21:50:47,400
back to that issue in a moment but

34519
21:50:44,600 --> 21:50:48,832
notice the URL ends in just slash and

34520
21:50:47,400 --> 21:50:50,511
again Chrome is hiding the slash because

34521
21:50:48,832 --> 21:50:54,552
that's all that's there but it does not

34522
21:50:50,512 --> 21:50:56,832
end in name equals David in this case or

34523
21:50:54,552 --> 21:50:59,480
name and equals world now notice this

34524
21:50:56,832 --> 21:51:02,080
too if I reload I'm going to get this

34525
21:50:59,480 --> 21:51:03,680
warning do you want to confirm form

34526
21:51:02,080 --> 21:51:04,920
resubmission the page you're looking for

34527
21:51:03,680 --> 21:51:06,359
used information that you entered

34528
21:51:04,920 --> 21:51:07,720
returning to that page might cause any

34529
21:51:06,360 --> 21:51:09,232
action you took to be repeated do you

34530
21:51:07,720 --> 21:51:10,872
want to continue you might have seen

34531
21:51:09,232 --> 21:51:12,920
this on websites you've actually visited

34532
21:51:10,872 --> 21:51:14,080
where you hit reload and you're prompted

34533
21:51:12,920 --> 21:51:16,080
wait a minute do you want to do that

34534
21:51:14,080 --> 21:51:18,480
odds are you've been prompted to reload

34535
21:51:16,080 --> 21:51:21,832
explicitly because why whatever you just

34536
21:51:18,480 --> 21:51:23,640
did was post instead of get and by

34537
21:51:21,832 --> 21:51:26,080
convention besides post being used for

34538
21:51:23,640 --> 21:51:27,512
privacy to like hide your username your

34539
21:51:26,080 --> 21:51:29,440
password your credit card number or the

34540
21:51:27,512 --> 21:51:32,440
like besides being used to upload bigger

34541
21:51:29,440 --> 21:51:34,680
files like images or videos post is also

34542
21:51:32,440 --> 21:51:36,640
used by convention to make changes to

34543
21:51:34,680 --> 21:51:38,552
the server to add something to your

34544
21:51:36,640 --> 21:51:40,160
shopping cart to add something to the

34545
21:51:38,552 --> 21:51:41,760
database whereas get is the name

34546
21:51:40,160 --> 21:51:44,512
suggests is all about getting

34547
21:51:41,760 --> 21:51:46,720
information not posting or sending

34548
21:51:44,512 --> 21:51:48,552
information instead so this is Chrome

34549
21:51:46,720 --> 21:51:50,080
being a little careful because you know

34550
21:51:48,552 --> 21:51:51,400
if you just checked out on Amazon and

34551
21:51:50,080 --> 21:51:53,232
then you hit reload you don't want to

34552
21:51:51,400 --> 21:51:55,480
accidentally like buy the same book

34553
21:51:53,232 --> 21:51:57,552
again so to speak even though Amazon and

34554
21:51:55,480 --> 21:52:00,360
fancy websites have other defenses for

34555
21:51:57,552 --> 21:52:03,192
this too to avoid this issue now there

34556
21:52:00,360 --> 21:52:05,320
is a bug though here it says hello comma

34557
21:52:03,192 --> 21:52:06,832
World instead of hello comma David and

34558
21:52:05,320 --> 21:52:09,192
it actually would have said the same a

34559
21:52:06,832 --> 21:52:11,159
moment ago and I just didn't retest the

34560
21:52:09,192 --> 21:52:12,920
code and reveal as much to you or if I

34561
21:52:11,160 --> 21:52:15,280
did I didn't even notice it said hello

34562
21:52:12,920 --> 21:52:19,360
world instead of hello David it turns

34563
21:52:15,280 --> 21:52:22,720
out that request. RGS is only used for

34564
21:52:19,360 --> 21:52:24,192
get when using get request. args is a

34565
21:52:22,720 --> 21:52:26,760
dictionary that contains all of your key

34566
21:52:24,192 --> 21:52:29,080
value pairs but somewhat confusingly

34567
21:52:26,760 --> 21:52:32,231
when using post with flask you have to

34568
21:52:29,080 --> 21:52:33,760
go into request. form I have no idea why

34569
21:52:32,232 --> 21:52:36,080
these are not sort of more obvious

34570
21:52:33,760 --> 21:52:39,280
opposites like request.get or request.

34571
21:52:36,080 --> 21:52:41,480
form and sorry request.get and request.

34572
21:52:39,280 --> 21:52:43,640
poost would be sort of sensible names in

34573
21:52:41,480 --> 21:52:47,192
this case though we have request. args

34574
21:52:43,640 --> 21:52:48,552
for get and request. form for post all

34575
21:52:47,192 --> 21:52:50,360
right that's an easy fix though if I go

34576
21:52:48,552 --> 21:52:53,720
back to vs code here let's change

34577
21:52:50,360 --> 21:52:56,440
request. ARS to request. form let's go

34578
21:52:53,720 --> 21:52:58,040
back to my other tab let me just reload

34579
21:52:56,440 --> 21:53:00,120
and you know what I'm going to say okay

34580
21:52:58,040 --> 21:53:01,959
continue to resubmit the same form

34581
21:53:00,120 --> 21:53:04,720
because the form was okay it was my

34582
21:53:01,960 --> 21:53:07,440
python code that was buggy hitting enter

34583
21:53:04,720 --> 21:53:09,480
now it's accessing David okay but watch

34584
21:53:07,440 --> 21:53:11,872
this again if I hit reload command r or

34585
21:53:09,480 --> 21:53:13,832
control r i get the same warning are you

34586
21:53:11,872 --> 21:53:15,800
sure you want to submit the form yes if

34587
21:53:13,832 --> 21:53:18,080
I do it manually with the reload icon I

34588
21:53:15,800 --> 21:53:20,512
get the same warning as before but if I

34589
21:53:18,080 --> 21:53:22,512
want to manually induce a get request

34590
21:53:20,512 --> 21:53:24,512
well that's fine don't hit reload and

34591
21:53:22,512 --> 21:53:27,400
send the same request instead go up to

34592
21:53:24,512 --> 21:53:29,760
your URL and just put the cursor up

34593
21:53:27,400 --> 21:53:32,720
there and hit enter and now notice same

34594
21:53:29,760 --> 21:53:35,280
URL is a get by default so anytime you

34595
21:53:32,720 --> 21:53:37,360
and I have typed URLs into browsers get

34596
21:53:35,280 --> 21:53:39,760
is always the default only when you

34597
21:53:37,360 --> 21:53:42,192
click on a button typically that the

34598
21:53:39,760 --> 21:53:44,040
programmer has configured to use post

34599
21:53:42,192 --> 21:53:47,192
are you actually adding things to your

34600
21:53:44,040 --> 21:53:51,040
shopping cart or the like all right so

34601
21:53:47,192 --> 21:53:53,360
we are back and if I go way back in time

34602
21:53:51,040 --> 21:53:57,599
myself like this is actually like the

34603
21:53:53,360 --> 21:54:01,440
first web application I made back in

34604
21:53:57,600 --> 21:54:03,192
1997 I believe uh so at the time this

34605
21:54:01,440 --> 21:54:05,080
was would have been what my sophomore or

34606
21:54:03,192 --> 21:54:07,120
so year I had taken cs50 I took a

34607
21:54:05,080 --> 21:54:08,680
follow- on class called cs51 which is a

34608
21:54:07,120 --> 21:54:10,400
different type of programming and then I

34609
21:54:08,680 --> 21:54:11,959
pretty much taught myself a language

34610
21:54:10,400 --> 21:54:13,832
called Pearl which is somewhat less

34611
21:54:11,960 --> 21:54:15,832
popular nowadays but it's another

34612
21:54:13,832 --> 21:54:17,319
language like python like Java like

34613
21:54:15,832 --> 21:54:19,319
JavaScript like others that can be used

34614
21:54:17,320 --> 21:54:22,400
to make web-based applications and the

34615
21:54:19,320 --> 21:54:24,320
web was very young at the time and the

34616
21:54:22,400 --> 21:54:26,000
process via which students my classmates

34617
21:54:24,320 --> 21:54:29,920
could register uh for the first year

34618
21:54:26,000 --> 21:54:31,360
intral sports program AKA Frost's was to

34619
21:54:29,920 --> 21:54:32,680
grab a piece of paper and like write

34620
21:54:31,360 --> 21:54:34,760
your name and email address on it and

34621
21:54:32,680 --> 21:54:36,511
walk it across across the yard to

34622
21:54:34,760 --> 21:54:37,959
Wigglesworth I believe where the Proctor

34623
21:54:36,512 --> 21:54:39,720
lived and you'd Slide the piece of paper

34624
21:54:37,960 --> 21:54:42,040
under the door and like that was how we

34625
21:54:39,720 --> 21:54:44,720
submitted forms in my day um so this was

34626
21:54:42,040 --> 21:54:47,040
an opportunity even back in 1997 is to

34627
21:54:44,720 --> 21:54:48,920
like move things online and the website

34628
21:54:47,040 --> 21:54:51,760
went on to live on until I think like

34629
21:54:48,920 --> 21:54:53,760
2007 I found this online and then it's

34630
21:54:51,760 --> 21:54:55,159
become something else since um but this

34631
21:54:53,760 --> 21:54:56,959
was a website via which people could

34632
21:54:55,160 --> 21:54:58,800
register for sports and people could log

34633
21:54:56,960 --> 21:55:00,872
in the scores for various games and

34634
21:54:58,800 --> 21:55:01,872
whatnot and so underneath the hood I

34635
21:55:00,872 --> 21:55:03,872
didn't even know anything anything about

34636
21:55:01,872 --> 21:55:06,640
databases at the time it was just like

34637
21:55:03,872 --> 21:55:09,120
CSV files that I was storing the data in

34638
21:55:06,640 --> 21:55:11,000
but there were HTML forms and there was

34639
21:55:09,120 --> 21:55:12,920
with pearl the language at the time the

34640
21:55:11,000 --> 21:55:15,160
way to do the exact kind of stuff that

34641
21:55:12,920 --> 21:55:17,440
we've just been doing already with flask

34642
21:55:15,160 --> 21:55:19,640
and so what I thought we'd do is

34643
21:55:17,440 --> 21:55:22,760
Implement a slightly less ugly version

34644
21:55:19,640 --> 21:55:25,192
of this um repeating uh graphical

34645
21:55:22,760 --> 21:55:27,400
backgrounds were invogue in like 1997 as

34646
21:55:25,192 --> 21:55:29,120
you can see here um but this is where

34647
21:55:27,400 --> 21:55:31,480
these were the Aesthetics of the day uh

34648
21:55:29,120 --> 21:55:32,552
including the the so-called blink tag so

34649
21:55:31,480 --> 21:55:34,159
let's at least focus on the

34650
21:55:32,552 --> 21:55:35,680
functionality of this website and not so

34651
21:55:34,160 --> 21:55:37,160
much the Aesthetics and see if we can't

34652
21:55:35,680 --> 21:55:38,640
Implement some of the plumbing for

34653
21:55:37,160 --> 21:55:40,040
actually solving like a real world

34654
21:55:38,640 --> 21:55:42,000
representative problem be it for

34655
21:55:40,040 --> 21:55:43,280
freshman inal sports or something else

34656
21:55:42,000 --> 21:55:45,872
like it where you're getting data from

34657
21:55:43,280 --> 21:55:47,872
users and processing it somehow so let

34658
21:55:45,872 --> 21:55:50,040
me go over here to VSS code let me

34659
21:55:47,872 --> 21:55:51,680
create a new directory called fros IMS

34660
21:55:50,040 --> 21:55:54,552
just so we can keep all of this code in

34661
21:55:51,680 --> 21:55:56,680
its own directory let me CD into fros

34662
21:55:54,552 --> 21:55:58,680
IMS let me proactively make another

34663
21:55:56,680 --> 21:56:02,192
directory called templates in which our

34664
21:55:58,680 --> 21:56:04,832
templates our HTML files do need to live

34665
21:56:02,192 --> 21:56:08,640
and eventually I'm going to go ahead and

34666
21:56:04,832 --> 21:56:10,680
create a two files minimally app.py and

34667
21:56:08,640 --> 21:56:13,872
index.html so let's do the first of

34668
21:56:10,680 --> 21:56:15,552
those app.py will live in my Frost im's

34669
21:56:13,872 --> 21:56:17,120
directory and I'm just going to recreate

34670
21:56:15,552 --> 21:56:20,280
something very simple like we have

34671
21:56:17,120 --> 21:56:23,680
previously so from flask in lowercase

34672
21:56:20,280 --> 21:56:25,920
import flask capitalized render template

34673
21:56:23,680 --> 21:56:27,640
and also request so same first line is

34674
21:56:25,920 --> 21:56:29,640
before let me then give myself a

34675
21:56:27,640 --> 21:56:31,960
variable called app set it equal to

34676
21:56:29,640 --> 21:56:33,720
calling the flask function capital f

34677
21:56:31,960 --> 21:56:37,600
with underscore uncore name underscore

34678
21:56:33,720 --> 21:56:41,760
uncore and then let me give myself a

34679
21:56:37,600 --> 21:56:43,160
route for slash as before with an index

34680
21:56:41,760 --> 21:56:45,280
function though again I could call that

34681
21:56:43,160 --> 21:56:47,512
anything I want and just for now let's

34682
21:56:45,280 --> 21:56:50,000
return render template of quote unquote

34683
21:56:47,512 --> 21:56:51,720
index.html as though that exists so this

34684
21:56:50,000 --> 21:56:53,960
is not really a web application as much

34685
21:56:51,720 --> 21:56:57,360
as it is at the moment just a recreation

34686
21:56:53,960 --> 21:57:01,120
of HTTP server for one file let's now in

34687
21:56:57,360 --> 21:57:02,360
another tab create a templates file uh

34688
21:57:01,120 --> 21:57:04,512
called called

34689
21:57:02,360 --> 21:57:06,800
index.html and I'm going to save myself

34690
21:57:04,512 --> 21:57:08,640
a few keystrokes I let me copy paste

34691
21:57:06,800 --> 21:57:10,232
from earlier almost all of the layout

34692
21:57:08,640 --> 21:57:13,040
from before I've change the title in

34693
21:57:10,232 --> 21:57:14,960
advance to frosts instead of hello but

34694
21:57:13,040 --> 21:57:16,719
this is essentially the same template

34695
21:57:14,960 --> 21:57:18,960
and for now though because I'm in an

34696
21:57:16,720 --> 21:57:21,512
index.html I'm not going to use extends

34697
21:57:18,960 --> 21:57:22,960
or any of that fancy block stuff yet I'm

34698
21:57:21,512 --> 21:57:25,000
just going to go ahead and create a

34699
21:57:22,960 --> 21:57:26,552
relatively simple form via which back in

34700
21:57:25,000 --> 21:57:29,552
the day my classmates could have

34701
21:57:26,552 --> 21:57:33,040
registered for interal Sports so let's

34702
21:57:29,552 --> 21:57:36,440
go ahead here and I'll propose that we

34703
21:57:33,040 --> 21:57:39,280
do this um in this page we'll have a

34704
21:57:36,440 --> 21:57:41,512
form the action of which will be a route

34705
21:57:39,280 --> 21:57:43,552
called SL register though I could call

34706
21:57:41,512 --> 21:57:45,320
that anything I want it'll be somewhat

34707
21:57:43,552 --> 21:57:47,280
private so I'm going to use post instead

34708
21:57:45,320 --> 21:57:49,280
of get just so that people don't

34709
21:57:47,280 --> 21:57:51,640
accidentally maybe register twice by

34710
21:57:49,280 --> 21:57:54,040
hitting reload uh without warning uh

34711
21:57:51,640 --> 21:57:57,280
inside of this form let's go ahead and

34712
21:57:54,040 --> 21:57:59,192
give them an input uh where autocomplete

34713
21:57:57,280 --> 21:58:02,000
will be off as always for demonstration

34714
21:57:59,192 --> 21:58:04,280
sake autofocus so the cursor goes there

34715
21:58:02,000 --> 21:58:05,760
initially the name of this field will be

34716
21:58:04,280 --> 21:58:07,000
literally named because I want my

34717
21:58:05,760 --> 21:58:09,192
classmates's name if they want to

34718
21:58:07,000 --> 21:58:11,000
register for some sport the placeholder

34719
21:58:09,192 --> 21:58:13,360
will again be quote unquote Nam just so

34720
21:58:11,000 --> 21:58:16,120
they see some gray instructions and the

34721
21:58:13,360 --> 21:58:18,720
type of this field will indeed be text

34722
21:58:16,120 --> 21:58:20,799
as before and then I need to give them

34723
21:58:18,720 --> 21:58:22,232
the ability to register for a few Sports

34724
21:58:20,800 --> 21:58:24,512
why don't we keep it simple like back in

34725
21:58:22,232 --> 21:58:26,080
the day basketball soccer and Ultimate

34726
21:58:24,512 --> 21:58:28,040
Frisbee were three of the sports that we

34727
21:58:26,080 --> 21:58:30,160
supported and so let me do this and you

34728
21:58:28,040 --> 21:58:31,959
might not have seen this before uh

34729
21:58:30,160 --> 21:58:33,720
unless you dabbled further on with forms

34730
21:58:31,960 --> 21:58:36,192
on your own but I can create a select

34731
21:58:33,720 --> 21:58:38,640
menu otherwise known as a drop-down menu

34732
21:58:36,192 --> 21:58:40,871
in HTML inside of which are a whole

34733
21:58:38,640 --> 21:58:42,640
bunch of options and each option

34734
21:58:40,872 --> 21:58:44,832
typically follows this Paradigm the

34735
21:58:42,640 --> 21:58:46,800
value of the option and then the actual

34736
21:58:44,832 --> 21:58:50,552
text that the human sees so the value of

34737
21:58:46,800 --> 21:58:53,480
these options will be how about we do uh

34738
21:58:50,552 --> 21:58:55,080
basketball as one and I want the human

34739
21:58:53,480 --> 21:58:56,920
to see literally the same thing though

34740
21:58:55,080 --> 21:58:58,480
just like with a link in HTML they could

34741
21:58:56,920 --> 21:59:01,640
be different but I'm going to keep them

34742
21:58:58,480 --> 21:59:03,480
the same another option will be

34743
21:59:01,640 --> 21:59:06,400
uh let's say

34744
21:59:03,480 --> 21:59:08,280
soccer and whoops let me fix my quotes

34745
21:59:06,400 --> 21:59:09,959
and this human will see the exact same

34746
21:59:08,280 --> 21:59:11,872
thing though it could say something else

34747
21:59:09,960 --> 21:59:15,000
and then lastly the value will be quote

34748
21:59:11,872 --> 21:59:18,040
unquote Ultimate Frisbee and the humans

34749
21:59:15,000 --> 21:59:20,232
will see the same thing there ultimate

34750
21:59:18,040 --> 21:59:21,680
frisbe all right so this is going to

34751
21:59:20,232 --> 21:59:23,800
create as we'll soon see just a drop-

34752
21:59:21,680 --> 21:59:25,511
down menu with three separate options if

34753
21:59:23,800 --> 21:59:26,920
I want the students to be able to submit

34754
21:59:25,512 --> 21:59:29,720
this now let me give them a button the

34755
21:59:26,920 --> 21:59:32,360
type of which is submit and this button

34756
21:59:29,720 --> 21:59:33,920
will be like the word register on it so

34757
21:59:32,360 --> 21:59:36,040
I think we're pretty much good to go

34758
21:59:33,920 --> 21:59:38,552
like this is all just HTML no python no

34759
21:59:36,040 --> 21:59:40,760
flask per se except for the rendering of

34760
21:59:38,552 --> 21:59:43,231
the same template so let me go into my

34761
21:59:40,760 --> 21:59:45,000
terminal window let me do flask run

34762
21:59:43,232 --> 21:59:46,800
inside of this directory because I need

34763
21:59:45,000 --> 21:59:48,600
to serve this app instead I'm going to

34764
21:59:46,800 --> 21:59:50,480
see some ugly output including my own

34765
21:59:48,600 --> 21:59:53,160
URL and if I hover over that and then

34766
21:59:50,480 --> 21:59:54,680
open that URL I should now see a more

34767
21:59:53,160 --> 21:59:56,480
interesting form it's got not only a

34768
21:59:54,680 --> 21:59:59,079
field for their name but also this

34769
21:59:56,480 --> 22:00:01,599
drop-down menu with all three Sports now

34770
21:59:59,080 --> 22:00:03,720
this isn't maybe the best user uh

34771
22:00:01,600 --> 22:00:05,720
experience thus far because I feel like

34772
22:00:03,720 --> 22:00:07,920
I'm biasing people to registering for

34773
22:00:05,720 --> 22:00:09,872
basketball maybe because it's checked by

34774
22:00:07,920 --> 22:00:11,680
default I mean a lot of forms nowadays

34775
22:00:09,872 --> 22:00:13,512
have like a blank placeholder for the

34776
22:00:11,680 --> 22:00:15,319
form so this is just an aesthetic thing

34777
22:00:13,512 --> 22:00:18,000
but I can do this let me go back to the

34778
22:00:15,320 --> 22:00:20,120
same form and let me give myself just a

34779
22:00:18,000 --> 22:00:22,440
a blank option at the top that in fact

34780
22:00:20,120 --> 22:00:24,680
I'm going to disable so you technically

34781
22:00:22,440 --> 22:00:26,832
can't select it proactively but I am

34782
22:00:24,680 --> 22:00:28,511
going to select it by default and so we

34783
22:00:26,832 --> 22:00:30,439
probably haven't seen those HTML

34784
22:00:28,512 --> 22:00:33,640
attributes before but if I want to

34785
22:00:30,440 --> 22:00:35,720
create the equivalent of like a a a

34786
22:00:33,640 --> 22:00:37,920
title for this dropdown I'm going to

34787
22:00:35,720 --> 22:00:39,872
literally create a disabled option

34788
22:00:37,920 --> 22:00:41,920
that's automatically selected called

34789
22:00:39,872 --> 22:00:44,120
sport so that you can't select it per se

34790
22:00:41,920 --> 22:00:47,192
but it is there at the top so if I go

34791
22:00:44,120 --> 22:00:48,760
back now to my other tab reload you know

34792
22:00:47,192 --> 22:00:50,480
it's just marginally prettier than

34793
22:00:48,760 --> 22:00:52,159
before and I'm not biasing people toward

34794
22:00:50,480 --> 22:00:54,000
accidentally registering for basketball

34795
22:00:52,160 --> 22:00:55,960
alone and if I click on this you'll see

34796
22:00:54,000 --> 22:00:57,960
that sport is great out and therefore

34797
22:00:55,960 --> 22:01:00,440
not manually selectable but I can select

34798
22:00:57,960 --> 22:01:02,400
any of these other three still all right

34799
22:01:00,440 --> 22:01:04,160
well un unfortunately if I type in David

34800
22:01:02,400 --> 22:01:08,159
and I try registering for instance for

34801
22:01:04,160 --> 22:01:10,832
soccer and click register I do end up

34802
22:01:08,160 --> 22:01:12,872
atreg and there's no question mark or

34803
22:01:10,832 --> 22:01:15,480
name or sport so it's probably indeed

34804
22:01:12,872 --> 22:01:19,920
post instead of get those are hints but

34805
22:01:15,480 --> 22:01:22,800
not found notice the tab here very uh uh

34806
22:01:19,920 --> 22:01:26,280
uh succinctly says 404 not found well

34807
22:01:22,800 --> 22:01:29,120
why is that just to be clear why did SL

34808
22:01:26,280 --> 22:01:29,120
register give me a

34809
22:01:29,872 --> 22:01:37,120
404 what's the logic

34810
22:01:32,960 --> 22:01:39,400
here perhaps just State the obvious

34811
22:01:37,120 --> 22:01:41,040
or it doesn't exist right we haven't

34812
22:01:39,400 --> 22:01:42,599
done that step yet all right so

34813
22:01:41,040 --> 22:01:44,920
something as simple as that and so I

34814
22:01:42,600 --> 22:01:46,360
actually U sort of belabor that point

34815
22:01:44,920 --> 22:01:47,959
because as you're learning like a lot of

34816
22:01:46,360 --> 22:01:49,080
these conventions and some of this new

34817
22:01:47,960 --> 22:01:50,512
syntax like honestly you're just going

34818
22:01:49,080 --> 22:01:52,600
to make stupid mistakes something's not

34819
22:01:50,512 --> 22:01:54,720
going to work but again go back to First

34820
22:01:52,600 --> 22:01:56,680
principles why is it not found all

34821
22:01:54,720 --> 22:01:58,832
right/ register should be a template

34822
22:01:56,680 --> 22:02:00,719
maybe called register. HTML oh I forgot

34823
22:01:58,832 --> 22:02:02,720
my app. route so that should be the kind

34824
22:02:00,720 --> 22:02:04,440
of of thinking as you try to diagnose

34825
22:02:02,720 --> 22:02:07,360
these problems moving forward all right

34826
22:02:04,440 --> 22:02:10,192
so let me go into app. and let me give

34827
22:02:07,360 --> 22:02:13,400
myself a second route here uh so app.

34828
22:02:10,192 --> 22:02:15,231
route quote unquote SL route then let me

34829
22:02:13,400 --> 22:02:17,231
Define a function called anything I want

34830
22:02:15,232 --> 22:02:19,872
but I'm going to call it oh sorry not SL

34831
22:02:17,232 --> 22:02:22,280
route SL register let me call the

34832
22:02:19,872 --> 22:02:24,600
function just to be consistent register

34833
22:02:22,280 --> 22:02:26,440
so but I could call that anything I want

34834
22:02:24,600 --> 22:02:28,760
and just for now let's not do anything

34835
22:02:26,440 --> 22:02:30,872
too interesting let's just return the

34836
22:02:28,760 --> 22:02:32,871
rendering of a template called success

34837
22:02:30,872 --> 22:02:34,512
.html let's just pretend for now that

34838
22:02:32,872 --> 22:02:36,872
registration is successful no matter who

34839
22:02:34,512 --> 22:02:39,720
you are or what you do now I need that

34840
22:02:36,872 --> 22:02:41,480
template and I only have index.html at

34841
22:02:39,720 --> 22:02:44,080
this point so let me actually now do my

34842
22:02:41,480 --> 22:02:47,231
best practices let me copy all of that

34843
22:02:44,080 --> 22:02:49,872
let me in a separate terminal window let

34844
22:02:47,232 --> 22:02:52,040
me do code uh let me go into my Frost

34845
22:02:49,872 --> 22:02:54,360
im's directory and let me create a new

34846
22:02:52,040 --> 22:02:57,280
template called layout. HTML just like

34847
22:02:54,360 --> 22:02:59,680
before let me paste all that same code

34848
22:02:57,280 --> 22:03:03,160
let me delete the form and just put in

34849
22:02:59,680 --> 22:03:06,832
that big placehold folder so block body

34850
22:03:03,160 --> 22:03:08,440
and then end block is all I did earlier

34851
22:03:06,832 --> 22:03:09,832
this is just kind of boiler plate now

34852
22:03:08,440 --> 22:03:11,040
convention everything else I'm going to

34853
22:03:09,832 --> 22:03:13,360
leave the same but if I wanted to make

34854
22:03:11,040 --> 22:03:15,159
it prettier I could add my CSS up top if

34855
22:03:13,360 --> 22:03:16,920
I wanted to add like this crazy

34856
22:03:15,160 --> 22:03:18,832
repeating background I could probably do

34857
22:03:16,920 --> 22:03:20,680
that up top too so I could make every

34858
22:03:18,832 --> 22:03:22,480
page look as ugly as it did back in my

34859
22:03:20,680 --> 22:03:24,719
day but we'll focus just today on the

34860
22:03:22,480 --> 22:03:28,680
text all right so now that I have

34861
22:03:24,720 --> 22:03:30,920
layout. HTML let me clean up index.html

34862
22:03:28,680 --> 22:03:32,871
I don't need all this redundancy I don't

34863
22:03:30,920 --> 22:03:36,160
need all of these tags at the top

34864
22:03:32,872 --> 22:03:40,000
instead recall I think I just need

34865
22:03:36,160 --> 22:03:42,080
extends quote unquote layout. HTML with

34866
22:03:40,000 --> 22:03:44,640
the appropriate percent signs and curly

34867
22:03:42,080 --> 22:03:46,400
braces I then have the appropriate block

34868
22:03:44,640 --> 22:03:47,872
body though I could call Body anything I

34869
22:03:46,400 --> 22:03:49,760
want but I'm going to stick with my

34870
22:03:47,872 --> 22:03:51,720
convention earlier and I'm going to

34871
22:03:49,760 --> 22:03:54,000
delete the tags down here that I no

34872
22:03:51,720 --> 22:03:56,600
longer need why because if I go into

34873
22:03:54,000 --> 22:03:59,040
layout. HTML I already have all my open

34874
22:03:56,600 --> 22:04:01,760
tags all my Clos tags the only stuff I

34875
22:03:59,040 --> 22:04:04,871
want in index.html is is going to be

34876
22:04:01,760 --> 22:04:07,280
which belongs in the body so end block

34877
22:04:04,872 --> 22:04:09,120
down here and just to be pedantic let me

34878
22:04:07,280 --> 22:04:11,680
go ahead and highlight all that hit

34879
22:04:09,120 --> 22:04:14,120
shift Tab and that will like unindent it

34880
22:04:11,680 --> 22:04:15,599
just to line things up just to be tidy

34881
22:04:14,120 --> 22:04:17,400
all right so better even though it looks

34882
22:04:15,600 --> 22:04:19,120
a little cryptic now but now I've laid

34883
22:04:17,400 --> 22:04:21,040
the foundation for making a third page a

34884
22:04:19,120 --> 22:04:23,192
fourth page that don't have all of that

34885
22:04:21,040 --> 22:04:26,400
same copy paste all right so now let's

34886
22:04:23,192 --> 22:04:28,159
go back into app.py success. HTML is

34887
22:04:26,400 --> 22:04:30,680
where I left off so okay let me open my

34888
22:04:28,160 --> 22:04:33,512
terminal window let me code up a

34889
22:04:30,680 --> 22:04:35,000
template called success. HTML whose

34890
22:04:33,512 --> 22:04:37,480
purpose in life is literally just going

34891
22:04:35,000 --> 22:04:39,120
to be like to say you are registered

34892
22:04:37,480 --> 22:04:41,231
just so that we see some informative

34893
22:04:39,120 --> 22:04:44,400
message on the screen so this part I do

34894
22:04:41,232 --> 22:04:46,920
still need extends layout. HTML so

34895
22:04:44,400 --> 22:04:49,192
there's a little bit of copy paste still

34896
22:04:46,920 --> 22:04:51,192
which is a little ugly but so be it

34897
22:04:49,192 --> 22:04:53,231
block body for this template and I'm

34898
22:04:51,192 --> 22:04:56,080
just going to say you are registered

34899
22:04:53,232 --> 22:04:58,400
exclamation point all right and then end

34900
22:04:56,080 --> 22:05:00,192
block so super simple it's just an

34901
22:04:58,400 --> 22:05:02,511
informative message claiming that the

34902
22:05:00,192 --> 22:05:04,720
Stu the student is registered all right

34903
22:05:02,512 --> 22:05:06,760
let's go back to the original form which

34904
22:05:04,720 --> 22:05:09,760
is this let me reload to make sure my

34905
22:05:06,760 --> 22:05:11,760
HTML has reloaded type in David I'm

34906
22:05:09,760 --> 22:05:15,040
going to register again for soccer and

34907
22:05:11,760 --> 22:05:18,080
click register and oh interesting method

34908
22:05:15,040 --> 22:05:20,040
not allowed so I'm not getting a 404

34909
22:05:18,080 --> 22:05:23,040
anymore I'm getting

34910
22:05:20,040 --> 22:05:25,832
405 at SL

34911
22:05:23,040 --> 22:05:28,832
register what's the deduction here how

34912
22:05:25,832 --> 22:05:28,832
did I screw up this

34913
22:05:28,872 --> 22:05:34,080
time 405 is progress yeah the

34914
22:05:31,920 --> 22:05:36,680
placeholder uh so it's not the

34915
22:05:34,080 --> 22:05:38,552
placeholder I think is okay this is now

34916
22:05:36,680 --> 22:05:42,120
about the underlying HTTP stuff the

34917
22:05:38,552 --> 22:05:45,552
method was disallow was not

34918
22:05:42,120 --> 22:05:47,480
allowed say again so get purposes post

34919
22:05:45,552 --> 22:05:49,832
thing too so by default all of these

34920
22:05:47,480 --> 22:05:51,231
routes in flask just by default assume

34921
22:05:49,832 --> 22:05:53,159
get because it's safe it doesn't allow

34922
22:05:51,232 --> 22:05:55,280
you to send information to the server in

34923
22:05:53,160 --> 22:05:57,480
quite the same way but if I do want to

34924
22:05:55,280 --> 22:05:59,872
support post recall that we changed this

34925
22:05:57,480 --> 22:06:01,720
to be methods equals and then a list

34926
22:05:59,872 --> 22:06:04,320
with quote quote Post in it so I just

34927
22:06:01,720 --> 22:06:06,552
need to enable support for that method

34928
22:06:04,320 --> 22:06:08,640
that that is that HTTP verb all right

34929
22:06:06,552 --> 22:06:09,959
let's go back to the form reload just to

34930
22:06:08,640 --> 22:06:12,120
make sure I haven't screwed up type in

34931
22:06:09,960 --> 22:06:15,120
my name David select soccer from the

34932
22:06:12,120 --> 22:06:18,120
dropdown click register and now I'm not

34933
22:06:15,120 --> 22:06:19,680
only at SL register in the URL it claims

34934
22:06:18,120 --> 22:06:20,871
that I am indeed registered now of

34935
22:06:19,680 --> 22:06:22,231
course I'm not I've done nothing

34936
22:06:20,872 --> 22:06:24,480
interesting there's no database there's

34937
22:06:22,232 --> 22:06:26,280
no CSV file we'll get to that in a bit

34938
22:06:24,480 --> 22:06:28,800
but at least I now have the plumbing in

34939
22:06:26,280 --> 22:06:31,552
place to do something Dynamic based on

34940
22:06:28,800 --> 22:06:34,832
that sport all right well how can I now

34941
22:06:31,552 --> 22:06:37,040
improve upon this how about we go ahead

34942
22:06:34,832 --> 22:06:38,799
and implement store the actual

34943
22:06:37,040 --> 22:06:40,159
registrant in a dictionary in the

34944
22:06:38,800 --> 22:06:41,832
computer's memory so instead of just

34945
22:06:40,160 --> 22:06:43,320
claiming that they're registered let's

34946
22:06:41,832 --> 22:06:44,959
actually make a notation and the

34947
22:06:43,320 --> 22:06:46,600
simplest way as we did weeks ago in

34948
22:06:44,960 --> 22:06:48,920
Python is just store things in like a

34949
22:06:46,600 --> 22:06:51,512
variable in memory like a list or a

34950
22:06:48,920 --> 22:06:53,040
dictionary a set anything like that all

34951
22:06:51,512 --> 22:06:55,320
right well let me go back into vs code

34952
22:06:53,040 --> 22:06:57,799
and in app.py and I think what I'm going

34953
22:06:55,320 --> 22:07:00,600
to have to do here is change my register

34954
22:06:57,800 --> 22:07:03,080
route to actually do some useful

34955
22:07:00,600 --> 22:07:05,600
information but before I register the

34956
22:07:03,080 --> 22:07:07,800
user let's consider where I want to

34957
22:07:05,600 --> 22:07:12,440
actually put them and so let me propose

34958
22:07:07,800 --> 22:07:14,832
that how about we do this at the top of

34959
22:07:12,440 --> 22:07:18,040
my file let me go ahead and declare a

34960
22:07:14,832 --> 22:07:21,552
global variable called registrant uh and

34961
22:07:18,040 --> 22:07:22,959
set that equal to an empty dictionary so

34962
22:07:21,552 --> 22:07:24,440
we've done this before when we were

34963
22:07:22,960 --> 22:07:26,280
playing around previously with using

34964
22:07:24,440 --> 22:07:27,400
dictionaries to store key value Pairs

34965
22:07:26,280 --> 22:07:29,600
and I'm going to propose that we store

34966
22:07:27,400 --> 22:07:30,760
the registrant as a dictionary why cuz

34967
22:07:29,600 --> 22:07:33,192
I'm going to keep it simple like the

34968
22:07:30,760 --> 22:07:34,360
name is going to be the student's name

34969
22:07:33,192 --> 22:07:35,799
sorry the key is going to be the

34970
22:07:34,360 --> 22:07:37,832
student's name and the value is going to

34971
22:07:35,800 --> 22:07:39,552
be whatever sport they registered for so

34972
22:07:37,832 --> 22:07:41,511
David and soccer and Carter and

34973
22:07:39,552 --> 22:07:43,512
basketball and so it kind of makes sense

34974
22:07:41,512 --> 22:07:46,080
for like a two column dictionary so to

34975
22:07:43,512 --> 22:07:47,800
speak as we often depict it on screen so

34976
22:07:46,080 --> 22:07:50,232
how can I use this dictionary well let

34977
22:07:47,800 --> 22:07:53,400
me go ahead and do this down here under

34978
22:07:50,232 --> 22:07:55,960
SL register let me go ahead and

34979
22:07:53,400 --> 22:07:59,760
initially do this how about we get the

34980
22:07:55,960 --> 22:08:01,552
user's name from request. form. Get and

34981
22:07:59,760 --> 22:08:02,640
set it equal to whatever the value of

34982
22:08:01,552 --> 22:08:03,872
name is and I'm not going to give a

34983
22:08:02,640 --> 22:08:06,040
default value now because I don't want

34984
22:08:03,872 --> 22:08:07,600
to call the student world or something

34985
22:08:06,040 --> 22:08:09,360
strange like that I'm just going to

34986
22:08:07,600 --> 22:08:10,680
assume for now that it's there let's

34987
22:08:09,360 --> 22:08:13,800
then create another variable called

34988
22:08:10,680 --> 22:08:15,832
Sport and do request. form doget quote

34989
22:08:13,800 --> 22:08:18,320
unquote sport to get these students

34990
22:08:15,832 --> 22:08:19,720
Sport and then let's go ahead and do

34991
22:08:18,320 --> 22:08:22,640
this in the

34992
22:08:19,720 --> 22:08:24,760
registrant dictionary let's index into

34993
22:08:22,640 --> 22:08:27,760
it using the student's name and let's

34994
22:08:24,760 --> 22:08:29,192
set it equal to whatever the sport is so

34995
22:08:27,760 --> 22:08:31,231
I've got these variables just to keep my

34996
22:08:29,192 --> 22:08:35,680
code tidy and I'm now putting a key

34997
22:08:31,232 --> 22:08:38,320
value pair in that uh into that

34998
22:08:35,680 --> 22:08:41,120
dictionary all right well what do I want

34999
22:08:38,320 --> 22:08:43,480
to now do and I'll I'll go ahead and say

35000
22:08:41,120 --> 22:08:45,599
success. HTML sure let's go ahead and do

35001
22:08:43,480 --> 22:08:47,680
that but now I think success. HTML means

35002
22:08:45,600 --> 22:08:52,680
that so let me go back to the form

35003
22:08:47,680 --> 22:08:55,959
reload let me type in David and soccer

35004
22:08:52,680 --> 22:09:01,400
register okay let me go back and say

35005
22:08:55,960 --> 22:09:03,760
Carter and basketball registered okay

35006
22:09:01,400 --> 22:09:05,760
now let's see what I want to do next how

35007
22:09:03,760 --> 22:09:08,552
about I go

35008
22:09:05,760 --> 22:09:11,640
into um Let me give myself another route

35009
22:09:08,552 --> 22:09:14,159
and let's play around here so app. route

35010
22:09:11,640 --> 22:09:16,400
let's give myself another third route

35011
22:09:14,160 --> 22:09:17,832
called registrant whose purpose in life

35012
22:09:16,400 --> 22:09:19,159
is just to show me who all of those

35013
22:09:17,832 --> 22:09:21,192
registrants are just like you would

35014
22:09:19,160 --> 22:09:22,440
expect from a website like this and then

35015
22:09:21,192 --> 22:09:25,040
let me Define a function called

35016
22:09:22,440 --> 22:09:27,480
registrants or anything else and then

35017
22:09:25,040 --> 22:09:29,159
let me return the rendering of a

35018
22:09:27,480 --> 22:09:33,552
template called

35019
22:09:29,160 --> 22:09:35,192
registrant H ML and let me pass in this

35020
22:09:33,552 --> 22:09:37,000
is kind of neat I can do registrant

35021
22:09:35,192 --> 22:09:39,440
equals registrant which again looks

35022
22:09:37,000 --> 22:09:41,320
weird but what am I doing I'm presuming

35023
22:09:39,440 --> 22:09:44,400
to pass in a placeholder called

35024
22:09:41,320 --> 22:09:46,320
registrant the value of which is this

35025
22:09:44,400 --> 22:09:48,552
dictionary that I've been collecting all

35026
22:09:46,320 --> 22:09:50,040
of the registrations in so similar to

35027
22:09:48,552 --> 22:09:51,720
the name placeholder before but it's a

35028
22:09:50,040 --> 22:09:53,319
little more powerful because now it's a

35029
22:09:51,720 --> 22:09:56,872
whole dictionary not just a single

35030
22:09:53,320 --> 22:09:59,160
string so I think now let me be creative

35031
22:09:56,872 --> 22:10:03,360
here let me go into my

35032
22:09:59,160 --> 22:10:06,832
templates under uh my templates folder

35033
22:10:03,360 --> 22:10:08,760
and let's do this uh let's go into uh my

35034
22:10:06,832 --> 22:10:11,760
terminal window let's create another

35035
22:10:08,760 --> 22:10:14,000
template called registrant HTML that's

35036
22:10:11,760 --> 22:10:16,680
actually going to do this displaying of

35037
22:10:14,000 --> 22:10:18,832
all of the registrant for us so extends

35038
22:10:16,680 --> 22:10:20,319
layout. HTML just so I can borrow all of

35039
22:10:18,832 --> 22:10:23,511
the same HTML as

35040
22:10:20,320 --> 22:10:26,800
before and let's define block body just

35041
22:10:23,512 --> 22:10:28,480
like before and inside of this and block

35042
22:10:26,800 --> 22:10:30,512
I want to put I don't know like a

35043
22:10:28,480 --> 22:10:32,360
bulleted list or an ordered list list of

35044
22:10:30,512 --> 22:10:35,720
all of the registrant so how can I do

35045
22:10:32,360 --> 22:10:39,232
this well let's do uh an unordered list

35046
22:10:35,720 --> 22:10:41,552
ul and here's where Ginger and flask

35047
22:10:39,232 --> 22:10:43,720
more generally get kind of interesting

35048
22:10:41,552 --> 22:10:44,832
like I want there to be something like

35049
22:10:43,720 --> 22:10:49,720
this An

35050
22:10:44,832 --> 22:10:53,040
Li uh and then like the students's name

35051
22:10:49,720 --> 22:10:55,480
and then an L uh maybe Li yeah like that

35052
22:10:53,040 --> 22:10:57,920
and then maybe like sport something like

35053
22:10:55,480 --> 22:11:00,120
this but I didn't pass in a name I

35054
22:10:57,920 --> 22:11:02,760
didn't pass in a sport I passed in the

35055
22:11:00,120 --> 22:11:03,959
entire dictionary of registrants now in

35056
22:11:02,760 --> 22:11:06,120
Python if we were just doing something

35057
22:11:03,960 --> 22:11:08,120
at the black and white terminal window

35058
22:11:06,120 --> 22:11:09,360
and doing a command line program you

35059
22:11:08,120 --> 22:11:12,319
know I'd probably have some kind of for

35060
22:11:09,360 --> 22:11:14,440
Loop in Python Ginger does allow you to

35061
22:11:12,320 --> 22:11:16,080
do this so a templating language tends

35062
22:11:14,440 --> 22:11:18,160
to come with very lightweight mechanisms

35063
22:11:16,080 --> 22:11:20,872
for doing placeholders doing Simple

35064
22:11:18,160 --> 22:11:23,440
Loops doing Simple conditions so python

35065
22:11:20,872 --> 22:11:25,360
like syntax and it's almost identical so

35066
22:11:23,440 --> 22:11:27,872
watch what I can do inside of this

35067
22:11:25,360 --> 22:11:30,440
unordered list let me not start to

35068
22:11:27,872 --> 22:11:33,360
manually output a single Li let me use

35069
22:11:30,440 --> 22:11:36,040
this syntax the same Ginger syntax that

35070
22:11:33,360 --> 22:11:38,720
I used for Block so curly brace percent

35071
22:11:36,040 --> 22:11:41,231
sign and I'm going to say this for name

35072
22:11:38,720 --> 22:11:43,360
in registrant so this is just like

35073
22:11:41,232 --> 22:11:45,320
python Syntax for iterating over a

35074
22:11:43,360 --> 22:11:48,000
dictionary and now this is going to look

35075
22:11:45,320 --> 22:11:50,512
stupid but the opposite of that is end4

35076
22:11:48,000 --> 22:11:52,800
so in HTML you use the slash in ginger

35077
22:11:50,512 --> 22:11:54,960
you literally use the word end no space

35078
22:11:52,800 --> 22:11:57,120
and then the name of the keyword so end4

35079
22:11:54,960 --> 22:11:59,640
is how you close this but this is where

35080
22:11:57,120 --> 22:12:03,280
templating gets really cool you can now

35081
22:11:59,640 --> 22:12:06,192
do Li and in here I can do something

35082
22:12:03,280 --> 22:12:08,232
like that student's name and that's it

35083
22:12:06,192 --> 22:12:10,319
I'm going to leave it like that and what

35084
22:12:08,232 --> 22:12:13,160
I'm doing here is using really a

35085
22:12:10,320 --> 22:12:15,400
template as templates are intended I've

35086
22:12:13,160 --> 22:12:17,360
got like the basic building blocks of

35087
22:12:15,400 --> 22:12:19,319
what I want this output to look like but

35088
22:12:17,360 --> 22:12:21,360
thanks to this little for Loop here

35089
22:12:19,320 --> 22:12:23,160
thanks to Ginger syntax the curly brace

35090
22:12:21,360 --> 22:12:24,832
and the percent sign I'm going to

35091
22:12:23,160 --> 22:12:27,160
iterate over every dictionary printing

35092
22:12:24,832 --> 22:12:28,760
out name name name name and so if I've

35093
22:12:27,160 --> 22:12:31,360
got two kids registered now I'm going to

35094
22:12:28,760 --> 22:12:34,319
see two liis David and Carter

35095
22:12:31,360 --> 22:12:39,720
respectively so let's see let me go back

35096
22:12:34,320 --> 22:12:41,160
to uh my Frost IM tab here and I don't

35097
22:12:39,720 --> 22:12:43,800
have a link yet so I got to do this

35098
22:12:41,160 --> 22:12:47,080
manually uh like a developer would let

35099
22:12:43,800 --> 22:12:48,600
me go to slash registrant and I'll zoom

35100
22:12:47,080 --> 22:12:50,512
out and hit

35101
22:12:48,600 --> 22:12:52,480
enter and you'll see what you'll

35102
22:12:50,512 --> 22:12:54,680
probably see two when making mistakes

35103
22:12:52,480 --> 22:12:56,231
for the first time in this world so

35104
22:12:54,680 --> 22:12:58,400
where is the error message unfortunately

35105
22:12:56,232 --> 22:13:00,280
internal Ser server error is not all

35106
22:12:58,400 --> 22:13:02,159
that useful but we do tell you you see

35107
22:13:00,280 --> 22:13:04,280
terminal window so if I go to the

35108
22:13:02,160 --> 22:13:05,760
terminal window I haven't been paying

35109
22:13:04,280 --> 22:13:07,360
attention to this for quite some time

35110
22:13:05,760 --> 22:13:09,120
and in fact I have two terminal windows

35111
22:13:07,360 --> 22:13:11,160
open so that I can still use commands at

35112
22:13:09,120 --> 22:13:13,760
the prompt but if I go back to my first

35113
22:13:11,160 --> 22:13:15,512
terminal window AKA bash there you'll

35114
22:13:13,760 --> 22:13:17,871
see in your terminal window When

35115
22:13:15,512 --> 22:13:20,160
developing web applications like all of

35116
22:13:17,872 --> 22:13:21,400
the mistakes you made in the terminal

35117
22:13:20,160 --> 22:13:23,160
itself this is one of those python

35118
22:13:21,400 --> 22:13:25,799
tracebacks that's related to me screwing

35119
22:13:23,160 --> 22:13:29,040
up here now let me go ahead here and

35120
22:13:25,800 --> 22:13:30,600
let's see uh type error function is not

35121
22:13:29,040 --> 22:13:35,360
iterable

35122
22:13:30,600 --> 22:13:35,360
and block for name function is not

35123
22:13:35,400 --> 22:13:40,360
iterable all right so what mistake did I

35124
22:13:38,280 --> 22:13:41,872
make well this is what happens when I

35125
22:13:40,360 --> 22:13:44,280
don't follow my notes and make changes

35126
22:13:41,872 --> 22:13:46,512
on the fly so I have this variable on

35127
22:13:44,280 --> 22:13:48,720
line five called registrant in all lower

35128
22:13:46,512 --> 22:13:51,600
case but what did I then do on the Fly

35129
22:13:48,720 --> 22:13:51,600
here in line

35130
22:13:52,232 --> 22:13:57,000
22 I defined a function called

35131
22:13:54,720 --> 22:13:58,400
registrant so like newbie mistake like I

35132
22:13:57,000 --> 22:13:59,832
shouldn't have done this I can't have a

35133
22:13:58,400 --> 22:14:01,400
variable and a function of the same name

35134
22:13:59,832 --> 22:14:03,439
name because the symbols are literally

35135
22:14:01,400 --> 22:14:05,280
identical so just to make clear that

35136
22:14:03,440 --> 22:14:07,832
this variable up here is actually Global

35137
22:14:05,280 --> 22:14:10,080
we'll use our convention like we did in

35138
22:14:07,832 --> 22:14:11,799
C often when we had a global variable

35139
22:14:10,080 --> 22:14:14,320
we'll capitalize it all just to make it

35140
22:14:11,800 --> 22:14:16,232
stand out like a a constant value up

35141
22:14:14,320 --> 22:14:19,400
there and so down here what I'm going to

35142
22:14:16,232 --> 22:14:21,040
do is pass in registrants in all cap so

35143
22:14:19,400 --> 22:14:22,832
that was stupid didn't mean to confuse

35144
22:14:21,040 --> 22:14:24,120
there but the reason for that error to

35145
22:14:22,832 --> 22:14:25,760
be clear is that you can't have a

35146
22:14:24,120 --> 22:14:26,920
function that's the same name as a

35147
22:14:25,760 --> 22:14:28,120
variable I could just change the

35148
22:14:26,920 --> 22:14:29,360
variable name alt together I'm going to

35149
22:14:28,120 --> 22:14:31,280
go ahead and just capitalize it to make

35150
22:14:29,360 --> 22:14:33,832
it really stand out that this is in fact

35151
22:14:31,280 --> 22:14:36,160
a global variable up top all right now

35152
22:14:33,832 --> 22:14:39,400
I'm going to go back to my browser let's

35153
22:14:36,160 --> 22:14:39,400
do David and

35154
22:14:40,552 --> 22:14:45,360
socer all right but there's going to be

35155
22:14:42,720 --> 22:14:47,552
some other mistakes here so on line 17

35156
22:14:45,360 --> 22:14:49,400
let me go ahead and change this variable

35157
22:14:47,552 --> 22:14:51,760
to be capitalized there because indeed I

35158
22:14:49,400 --> 22:14:53,799
want to put the key and the value in

35159
22:14:51,760 --> 22:14:55,959
this newly named variable as all

35160
22:14:53,800 --> 22:14:57,832
capitals registrant let me now go back

35161
22:14:55,960 --> 22:15:00,080
to vs code here let me go back to the

35162
22:14:57,832 --> 22:15:03,511
form and let me start adding some data

35163
22:15:00,080 --> 22:15:05,512
fresh let me register David for soccer

35164
22:15:03,512 --> 22:15:07,280
clicking register now and we should see

35165
22:15:05,512 --> 22:15:09,320
you are registered but hopefully now

35166
22:15:07,280 --> 22:15:12,552
it's indeed in the computer's memory let

35167
22:15:09,320 --> 22:15:15,160
me go back and register now Carter for

35168
22:15:12,552 --> 22:15:17,192
basketball clicking register again and

35169
22:15:15,160 --> 22:15:20,120
hopefully it's now registered if I now

35170
22:15:17,192 --> 22:15:22,192
change my route manually to B SL

35171
22:15:20,120 --> 22:15:24,799
registrant which is this newly added

35172
22:15:22,192 --> 22:15:27,760
route that I made and hit enter now I

35173
22:15:24,800 --> 22:15:29,680
see thank God now I see the unordered

35174
22:15:27,760 --> 22:15:31,599
list containing everything in the

35175
22:15:29,680 --> 22:15:33,719
computer's memory so when I say you are

35176
22:15:31,600 --> 22:15:35,552
registered I kind of mean it now because

35177
22:15:33,720 --> 22:15:38,080
the server is still running and in the

35178
22:15:35,552 --> 22:15:40,552
computer's memory is in this registrant

35179
22:15:38,080 --> 22:15:42,232
Global variable a dictionary of key

35180
22:15:40,552 --> 22:15:44,552
value pairs of course we're only seeing

35181
22:15:42,232 --> 22:15:47,040
the keys at the moment so it might be

35182
22:15:44,552 --> 22:15:50,760
nice to actually see the values in as

35183
22:15:47,040 --> 22:15:53,719
well so let me go back to VSS code and

35184
22:15:50,760 --> 22:15:55,159
let me go into registr trans. HTML and

35185
22:15:53,720 --> 22:15:57,872
I'll just do something a little messy

35186
22:15:55,160 --> 22:16:00,320
I'll just say uh how about let just make

35187
22:15:57,872 --> 22:16:03,640
it a sentence is registered

35188
22:16:00,320 --> 22:16:06,832
four and now another placeholder I'm

35189
22:16:03,640 --> 22:16:09,800
going to say registrant bracket name so

35190
22:16:06,832 --> 22:16:12,832
just like in Python if registr is itself

35191
22:16:09,800 --> 22:16:15,120
a dictionary registr bracket and then

35192
22:16:12,832 --> 22:16:17,871
the key you want to index into is

35193
22:16:15,120 --> 22:16:21,159
perfectly valid syntax as well so now

35194
22:16:17,872 --> 22:16:23,800
let me go back to SL registrant let me

35195
22:16:21,160 --> 22:16:26,000
click reload again so why isn't it

35196
22:16:23,800 --> 22:16:28,080
working everyone what's the bug that I

35197
22:16:26,000 --> 22:16:29,600
introduced earlier if David is

35198
22:16:28,080 --> 22:16:31,192
registered for none and Carter is

35199
22:16:29,600 --> 22:16:33,760
registered for none but David and Carter

35200
22:16:31,192 --> 22:16:36,720
are in the dictionary like that's a good

35201
22:16:33,760 --> 22:16:38,871
thing so some of the data is in there so

35202
22:16:36,720 --> 22:16:40,360
why are there no Sports Associated well

35203
22:16:38,872 --> 22:16:42,440
the first thing I literally just did in

35204
22:16:40,360 --> 22:16:45,000
front of you all was I went to app.py

35205
22:16:42,440 --> 22:16:47,080
and I stared at line 17 thinking like

35206
22:16:45,000 --> 22:16:49,400
how did I screw this up I'm putting

35207
22:16:47,080 --> 22:16:51,400
sport as the value of the key which is

35208
22:16:49,400 --> 22:16:53,192
the student's name all right line 17

35209
22:16:51,400 --> 22:16:55,760
looked fine to me a few seconds ago so I

35210
22:16:53,192 --> 22:16:57,400
looked then with my eyes at line 16 and

35211
22:16:55,760 --> 22:16:59,920
this too looked okay my first thought

35212
22:16:57,400 --> 22:17:02,079
was oh did I use request. args instead

35213
22:16:59,920 --> 22:17:04,080
of request. form instead because that

35214
22:17:02,080 --> 22:17:06,600
would have assumed get instead of post

35215
22:17:04,080 --> 22:17:08,872
but no like that looks okay too so then

35216
22:17:06,600 --> 22:17:11,040
my final Instinct was oh my god did I

35217
22:17:08,872 --> 22:17:13,440
screw up the HTML form and so that's why

35218
22:17:11,040 --> 22:17:16,799
I went back over to my tab here I went

35219
22:17:13,440 --> 22:17:19,552
to the original form here I then view

35220
22:17:16,800 --> 22:17:20,960
page source and this might not be as

35221
22:17:19,552 --> 22:17:24,080
obvious to you if you've never seen the

35222
22:17:20,960 --> 22:17:27,360
select menu before what is apparently

35223
22:17:24,080 --> 22:17:30,192
missing here that might explain my

35224
22:17:27,360 --> 22:17:32,960
mistake yeah

35225
22:17:30,192 --> 22:17:34,720
yeah I didn't name this form field quote

35226
22:17:32,960 --> 22:17:36,640
unquote sport now to be fair you haven't

35227
22:17:34,720 --> 22:17:38,400
seen me do this as a select menu before

35228
22:17:36,640 --> 22:17:40,080
and it's different from this input when

35229
22:17:38,400 --> 22:17:43,439
you have an input tag you literally say

35230
22:17:40,080 --> 22:17:44,920
name equals whatever on the input tag it

35231
22:17:43,440 --> 22:17:46,232
turns out I don't know why I skipped

35232
22:17:44,920 --> 22:17:48,319
this earlier I probably meant to come

35233
22:17:46,232 --> 22:17:50,920
back to it the select tag also can take

35234
22:17:48,320 --> 22:17:51,960
a name parameter so if I go back to the

35235
22:17:50,920 --> 22:17:54,160
name

35236
22:17:51,960 --> 22:17:56,512
parameter here and go back and add the

35237
22:17:54,160 --> 22:17:57,960
name parameter let me go into that

35238
22:17:56,512 --> 22:18:00,720
template which is

35239
22:17:57,960 --> 22:18:03,360
index.html let me add name equals quote

35240
22:18:00,720 --> 22:18:05,832
unquote sport in all lowercase which is

35241
22:18:03,360 --> 22:18:08,000
different from the visual aesthetic of

35242
22:18:05,832 --> 22:18:09,360
this temporary disabled option that's

35243
22:18:08,000 --> 22:18:13,320
just there to make things prettier for

35244
22:18:09,360 --> 22:18:15,552
the human now let me go ahead here and

35245
22:18:13,320 --> 22:18:17,400
first I'm going to go into my terminal

35246
22:18:15,552 --> 22:18:19,360
window and I'm actually going to hit

35247
22:18:17,400 --> 22:18:20,832
control C to stop the server alt

35248
22:18:19,360 --> 22:18:22,640
together because I want to throw away

35249
22:18:20,832 --> 22:18:24,159
the contents of memory and therefore get

35250
22:18:22,640 --> 22:18:26,319
rid of that dictionary that had David

35251
22:18:24,160 --> 22:18:27,832
and Carter and those nun values so this

35252
22:18:26,320 --> 22:18:31,192
is sort of me clearing the computer's

35253
22:18:27,832 --> 22:18:33,040
memory I'm going to rerun flask run I

35254
22:18:31,192 --> 22:18:35,040
get that same URL as before so I'm going

35255
22:18:33,040 --> 22:18:36,511
to hover over that and open the new tab

35256
22:18:35,040 --> 22:18:39,552
and just to be sure I'm going to do view

35257
22:18:36,512 --> 22:18:42,552
page source and here I see now okay now

35258
22:18:39,552 --> 22:18:44,231
the form has both a name and a sport in

35259
22:18:42,552 --> 22:18:46,280
it all right now I'm really going to

35260
22:18:44,232 --> 22:18:48,760
cross my fingers because I intend for

35261
22:18:46,280 --> 22:18:51,720
this now to work David will register

35262
22:18:48,760 --> 22:18:53,159
again for soccer register claims we are

35263
22:18:51,720 --> 22:18:55,832
registered I'm going to go back and do

35264
22:18:53,160 --> 22:18:57,872
it again for Carter and basketball

35265
22:18:55,832 --> 22:19:01,040
register we still don't have a link so

35266
22:18:57,872 --> 22:19:03,832
I'm going to manually go up to the URL

35267
22:19:01,040 --> 22:19:06,920
and change/ register to registrant as

35268
22:19:03,832 --> 22:19:09,159
before zooming out and hit enter and

35269
22:19:06,920 --> 22:19:13,319
thank God now I'm actually registered

35270
22:19:09,160 --> 22:19:13,320
properly for this so oh thank

35271
22:19:15,040 --> 22:19:18,799
you so what is it like 20 years later

35272
22:19:17,440 --> 22:19:22,000
I'm still struggling to implement this

35273
22:19:18,800 --> 22:19:24,280
site okay so um so here now we have for

35274
22:19:22,000 --> 22:19:25,512
the first time in Python and web stuff

35275
22:19:24,280 --> 22:19:27,080
like now we have a proper web

35276
22:19:25,512 --> 22:19:29,360
application and it's not just echoing

35277
22:19:27,080 --> 22:19:30,720
back hello David hello Carter this could

35278
22:19:29,360 --> 22:19:32,480
now work for any of you and it's

35279
22:19:30,720 --> 22:19:34,160
currently served privately but if I made

35280
22:19:32,480 --> 22:19:36,400
this URL public I could put this on the

35281
22:19:34,160 --> 22:19:39,280
web now and let anyone in the world

35282
22:19:36,400 --> 22:19:41,799
register but there's kind of some issues

35283
22:19:39,280 --> 22:19:43,640
here there's some security flaws

35284
22:19:41,800 --> 22:19:46,280
potentially and so for instance let me

35285
22:19:43,640 --> 22:19:48,760
go back to the web form here and let me

35286
22:19:46,280 --> 22:19:51,160
open up the inspect tab the developer

35287
22:19:48,760 --> 22:19:52,959
tools and just remind you that anyone on

35288
22:19:51,160 --> 22:19:55,440
the internet not only you the developer

35289
22:19:52,960 --> 22:19:57,760
but a an adversary can see all of your

35290
22:19:55,440 --> 22:19:59,800
HTML see all of your CSS see all of your

35291
22:19:57,760 --> 22:20:02,360
JavaScript but more importantly because

35292
22:19:59,800 --> 22:20:04,360
this is all client side in the browser

35293
22:20:02,360 --> 22:20:07,120
there is literally nothing technically

35294
22:20:04,360 --> 22:20:08,872
stopping them from changing the HTML or

35295
22:20:07,120 --> 22:20:10,599
at least their copy of it and I did that

35296
22:20:08,872 --> 22:20:12,320
last week with Yale I changed their

35297
22:20:10,600 --> 22:20:14,192
website but no I changed my copy of

35298
22:20:12,320 --> 22:20:16,400
their website but when forms get

35299
22:20:14,192 --> 22:20:18,959
involved you could maybe be actually

35300
22:20:16,400 --> 22:20:22,120
malicious now because even though this

35301
22:20:18,960 --> 22:20:24,640
drop-down menu only has basketball

35302
22:20:22,120 --> 22:20:28,832
soccer and Ultimate Frisbee suppose I

35303
22:20:24,640 --> 22:20:32,480
really want to register for how about uh

35304
22:20:28,832 --> 22:20:34,159
let's say uh name your favorite sport

35305
22:20:32,480 --> 22:20:36,480
volleyball we really want to register

35306
22:20:34,160 --> 22:20:38,552
for volleyball but like this website

35307
22:20:36,480 --> 22:20:39,832
won't let me well there's nothing

35308
22:20:38,552 --> 22:20:42,231
stopping me from going under the

35309
22:20:39,832 --> 22:20:44,920
elements tab in my browser going into

35310
22:20:42,232 --> 22:20:47,192
this select menu here and you know what

35311
22:20:44,920 --> 22:20:50,512
no one ultimate for me let's change this

35312
22:20:47,192 --> 22:20:53,552
to volleyball and let's change this to

35313
22:20:50,512 --> 22:20:56,800
volleyball enter I'm going to close the

35314
22:20:53,552 --> 22:21:00,159
inspector now and as requested now we

35315
22:20:56,800 --> 22:21:01,832
support volleyball in the form now now

35316
22:21:00,160 --> 22:21:04,440
it's not changed on the server to be

35317
22:21:01,832 --> 22:21:06,920
fair but think about how HTTP works when

35318
22:21:04,440 --> 22:21:09,160
I fill out this with uh say let's see

35319
22:21:06,920 --> 22:21:11,232
Bernie's name Bernie really wants to

35320
22:21:09,160 --> 22:21:13,360
register for volleyball as well at the

35321
22:21:11,232 --> 22:21:16,440
moment my code is just going to trust

35322
22:21:13,360 --> 22:21:19,120
that what's in request. form is what was

35323
22:21:16,440 --> 22:21:21,320
in the original form itself no matter

35324
22:21:19,120 --> 22:21:23,640
whether the human adversarially actually

35325
22:21:21,320 --> 22:21:25,640
changed it so if I actually submit this

35326
22:21:23,640 --> 22:21:27,800
form and click register for Bernie and

35327
22:21:25,640 --> 22:21:30,360
volleyball even though that's not one of

35328
22:21:27,800 --> 22:21:33,192
the supported available Sports if I now

35329
22:21:30,360 --> 22:21:35,440
go to registrant my website nonetheless

35330
22:21:33,192 --> 22:21:37,512
has trusted that uh Bernie and perhaps

35331
22:21:35,440 --> 22:21:39,120
you are registered for volleyball so

35332
22:21:37,512 --> 22:21:40,920
what's the implication of this this has

35333
22:21:39,120 --> 22:21:43,480
surely happened in the past when like

35334
22:21:40,920 --> 22:21:46,120
really poorly implemented websites um

35335
22:21:43,480 --> 22:21:47,872
allow you to uh specify the price of an

35336
22:21:46,120 --> 22:21:49,360
item for instance in your shopping cart

35337
22:21:47,872 --> 22:21:52,512
and they just trust that when you click

35338
22:21:49,360 --> 22:21:54,600
submit or add to cart it adds the price

35339
22:21:52,512 --> 22:21:56,600
to the backend server if you're not

35340
22:21:54,600 --> 22:21:58,480
validating the price and making sure as

35341
22:21:56,600 --> 22:21:59,832
with a database that wait a minute that

35342
22:21:58,480 --> 22:22:02,192
price is valid valid or wait a minute

35343
22:21:59,832 --> 22:22:03,680
those sports are valid like who knows

35344
22:22:02,192 --> 22:22:06,640
what people are going to do to your site

35345
22:22:03,680 --> 22:22:08,832
and it's that simple to actually hack a

35346
22:22:06,640 --> 22:22:11,319
website accordingly now we can very

35347
22:22:08,832 --> 22:22:13,439
easily fix this with some um some week

35348
22:22:11,320 --> 22:22:15,320
six style python we really just need to

35349
22:22:13,440 --> 22:22:18,480
do a bit of logic here and so let me

35350
22:22:15,320 --> 22:22:21,120
propose this let me go into app.py here

35351
22:22:18,480 --> 22:22:24,480
and at the very top let me also create

35352
22:22:21,120 --> 22:22:26,512
how about a uh Global variable called

35353
22:22:24,480 --> 22:22:28,512
Sports in all caps and I'm going to set

35354
22:22:26,512 --> 22:22:30,192
that equal to in square brackets the

35355
22:22:28,512 --> 22:22:31,800
list of Sports I actually want to

35356
22:22:30,192 --> 22:22:33,599
support so I'm going to put in

35357
22:22:31,800 --> 22:22:36,080
basketball here I'm going to put in

35358
22:22:33,600 --> 22:22:37,872
soccer here and I'm sorry no volleyball

35359
22:22:36,080 --> 22:22:39,872
officially I'm going to put in ultimate

35360
22:22:37,872 --> 22:22:42,640
frisbee here so I've got this Global

35361
22:22:39,872 --> 22:22:44,760
list of supported Sports now think about

35362
22:22:42,640 --> 22:22:46,920
how I made this form a while ago I just

35363
22:22:44,760 --> 22:22:49,319
hardcoded these Sports here well I don't

35364
22:22:46,920 --> 22:22:51,920
have to do that I can sort of draw upon

35365
22:22:49,320 --> 22:22:54,120
my own official list of sports instead

35366
22:22:51,920 --> 22:22:56,872
so let me scroll down to my

35367
22:22:54,120 --> 22:22:58,720
index.html rendering template here let

35368
22:22:56,872 --> 22:23:00,360
me say that the sports I want to support

35369
22:22:58,720 --> 22:23:03,040
are are these so just using the same

35370
22:23:00,360 --> 22:23:04,760
placeholder trick as before but I'm now

35371
22:23:03,040 --> 22:23:08,120
telling the template what sports we

35372
22:23:04,760 --> 22:23:10,599
currently support now if I go back into

35373
22:23:08,120 --> 22:23:12,552
index.html I don't have to manually do

35374
22:23:10,600 --> 22:23:14,280
any of this let me get rid of all three

35375
22:23:12,552 --> 22:23:16,720
of those options which I manually

35376
22:23:14,280 --> 22:23:20,160
inputed earlier let me use my new trick

35377
22:23:16,720 --> 22:23:22,600
with ginger syntax and say for sport in

35378
22:23:20,160 --> 22:23:24,720
sports then let me proactively say end

35379
22:23:22,600 --> 22:23:28,192
for just to finish that thought and then

35380
22:23:24,720 --> 22:23:30,960
in here let me do option value equals in

35381
22:23:28,192 --> 22:23:33,000
curly BRAC is Sport and then so that the

35382
22:23:30,960 --> 22:23:35,832
human also sees the same words I'm going

35383
22:23:33,000 --> 22:23:38,080
to say sport out here so I've completely

35384
22:23:35,832 --> 22:23:39,920
changed what was hardcoded manually

35385
22:23:38,080 --> 22:23:42,232
typed to something now that's completely

35386
22:23:39,920 --> 22:23:44,160
Dynamic so now it's not going to stop

35387
22:23:42,232 --> 22:23:46,832
someone adversar like me from changing

35388
22:23:44,160 --> 22:23:50,480
the HTML but watch this the behavior on

35389
22:23:46,832 --> 22:23:52,319
the form if we go back is still now the

35390
22:23:50,480 --> 22:23:54,231
same drop down as before so

35391
22:23:52,320 --> 22:23:55,872
aesthetically it looks the same but you

35392
22:23:54,232 --> 22:23:58,600
know what why don't we be clever now and

35393
22:23:55,872 --> 22:24:02,320
let's go into app.py and the/ register

35394
22:23:58,600 --> 22:24:07,320
route and why don't we say this uh if

35395
22:24:02,320 --> 22:24:12,320
how about sport not in sports then let's

35396
22:24:07,320 --> 22:24:14,040
return render template uh failure. HTML

35397
22:24:12,320 --> 22:24:15,800
now this template doesn't exist yet so

35398
22:24:14,040 --> 22:24:18,040
let me just quickly make this real fast

35399
22:24:15,800 --> 22:24:22,360
I'm going to copy that code from before

35400
22:24:18,040 --> 22:24:24,439
let me create a code file in uh failure.

35401
22:24:22,360 --> 22:24:26,160
HTML I'm just going to paste this here

35402
22:24:24,440 --> 22:24:27,552
so I have a super simple error message

35403
22:24:26,160 --> 22:24:29,552
and I'm going to say you are not

35404
22:24:27,552 --> 22:24:32,440
registered just to that's what we mean

35405
22:24:29,552 --> 22:24:35,231
by failure and now in app.py consider

35406
22:24:32,440 --> 22:24:38,552
what logic I've added Sports in all caps

35407
22:24:35,232 --> 22:24:41,960
on line 22 is that same Global list as

35408
22:24:38,552 --> 22:24:44,280
before by asking pythonic if sport not

35409
22:24:41,960 --> 22:24:46,192
in sports well then you hacked me like

35410
22:24:44,280 --> 22:24:49,920
you tried to inject volleyball or some

35411
22:24:46,192 --> 22:24:51,959
other sport into request. form so I'm

35412
22:24:49,920 --> 22:24:54,512
just going to say no failure not letting

35413
22:24:51,960 --> 22:24:57,960
you register and I can do this a little

35414
22:24:54,512 --> 22:25:00,280
more uh verbosely too why don't I also

35415
22:24:57,960 --> 22:25:03,080
say this if if not name so if the name

35416
22:25:00,280 --> 22:25:06,552
is blank let's similarly return a render

35417
22:25:03,080 --> 22:25:07,872
template of failure. HTML in other words

35418
22:25:06,552 --> 22:25:09,480
if you didn't give me a name you left it

35419
22:25:07,872 --> 22:25:11,600
blank that's not useful for me running

35420
22:25:09,480 --> 22:25:13,760
the sports program let's also consider

35421
22:25:11,600 --> 22:25:15,832
that to be a failure so if I go back to

35422
22:25:13,760 --> 22:25:17,799
this tab now I'm going to reload just to

35423
22:25:15,832 --> 22:25:20,000
make sure I have the latest client side

35424
22:25:17,800 --> 22:25:22,160
let me be lazy and just click register

35425
22:25:20,000 --> 22:25:24,192
enter you are not registered because I

35426
22:25:22,160 --> 22:25:26,080
didn't give it an actual name all right

35427
22:25:24,192 --> 22:25:27,832
well let's go back how about I now type

35428
22:25:26,080 --> 22:25:31,080
David but no no I'm not going to choose

35429
22:25:27,832 --> 22:25:33,231
a sport I just want register myself nope

35430
22:25:31,080 --> 22:25:37,040
that did not work now let me go ahead

35431
22:25:33,232 --> 22:25:39,640
here and choose soccer this I think does

35432
22:25:37,040 --> 22:25:42,480
work let me go back now and try this

35433
22:25:39,640 --> 22:25:46,160
hacker trick whereby I go into the drop-

35434
22:25:42,480 --> 22:25:48,640
down menu I go into the select menu I

35435
22:25:46,160 --> 22:25:50,720
change as before Ultimate Frisbee to

35436
22:25:48,640 --> 22:25:52,040
volleyball and I'll change this one here

35437
22:25:50,720 --> 22:25:55,512
to

35438
22:25:52,040 --> 22:25:57,920
volleyball let me close the tab now this

35439
22:25:55,512 --> 22:26:00,680
looks like it's available now but when I

35440
22:25:57,920 --> 22:26:03,120
click register this this time it says

35441
22:26:00,680 --> 22:26:05,000
you are not registered and this is much

35442
22:26:03,120 --> 22:26:07,000
better than relying on other techniques

35443
22:26:05,000 --> 22:26:08,920
you might see or have seen online with

35444
22:26:07,000 --> 22:26:11,232
regard to HTML because there's also this

35445
22:26:08,920 --> 22:26:13,599
trick let me go back to the screen here

35446
22:26:11,232 --> 22:26:14,872
let me go back to index.html and you

35447
22:26:13,600 --> 22:26:16,320
might have seen online or you might

35448
22:26:14,872 --> 22:26:18,640
eventually see online that there's other

35449
22:26:16,320 --> 22:26:20,440
attributes you can use like required you

35450
22:26:18,640 --> 22:26:22,400
can literally tell the browser uhuh this

35451
22:26:20,440 --> 22:26:24,640
field is required you cannot leave it

35452
22:26:22,400 --> 22:26:27,319
blank if I go back to the browser now

35453
22:26:24,640 --> 22:26:29,160
reload and I again presume to be lazy

35454
22:26:27,320 --> 22:26:31,160
and I don't type in any name and click

35455
22:26:29,160 --> 22:26:33,192
register okay so that's kind of nice

35456
22:26:31,160 --> 22:26:35,960
like now the browser is being a little

35457
22:26:33,192 --> 22:26:38,120
more helpful for me saying no no no this

35458
22:26:35,960 --> 22:26:39,920
is required you have to fill this out

35459
22:26:38,120 --> 22:26:42,080
but again if you know what you're doing

35460
22:26:39,920 --> 22:26:44,872
okay well I disagree with your requiring

35461
22:26:42,080 --> 22:26:46,960
a name of me let me go in here let me go

35462
22:26:44,872 --> 22:26:51,040
over to this tag let me delete the

35463
22:26:46,960 --> 22:26:52,920
required attribute and now I slip

35464
22:26:51,040 --> 22:26:54,439
through but I didn't slip through on the

35465
22:26:52,920 --> 22:26:56,040
server and so there's a difference here

35466
22:26:54,440 --> 22:26:57,360
and an important distinction and so many

35467
22:26:56,040 --> 22:27:00,079
people in the real world still screw

35468
22:26:57,360 --> 22:27:01,640
this up there's client side validation

35469
22:27:00,080 --> 22:27:03,192
like actually checking that the data is

35470
22:27:01,640 --> 22:27:05,552
as you expect on the client side the

35471
22:27:03,192 --> 22:27:07,280
browser and there server side validation

35472
22:27:05,552 --> 22:27:08,800
and even though client side validation

35473
22:27:07,280 --> 22:27:10,232
like adding that required attribute

35474
22:27:08,800 --> 22:27:11,680
makes things more user friendly right

35475
22:27:10,232 --> 22:27:12,920
like that was a pretty little popup it

35476
22:27:11,680 --> 22:27:15,192
tells me that it's required it just

35477
22:27:12,920 --> 22:27:18,120
looks better than the previous version

35478
22:27:15,192 --> 22:27:20,319
it is not trustable you cannot trust any

35479
22:27:18,120 --> 22:27:22,799
input that ever comes from the user

35480
22:27:20,320 --> 22:27:24,680
because clearly with like a an hour or

35481
22:27:22,800 --> 22:27:26,760
so of cs50 like they can learn how to

35482
22:27:24,680 --> 22:27:28,760
turn all of these defenses off so even

35483
22:27:26,760 --> 22:27:31,000
if you like the user interface better

35484
22:27:28,760 --> 22:27:33,959
client side you have to have to have to

35485
22:27:31,000 --> 22:27:35,832
do server side validation always users

35486
22:27:33,960 --> 22:27:38,080
are not to be trusted and as soon as any

35487
22:27:35,832 --> 22:27:39,832
app or website you make becomes popular

35488
22:27:38,080 --> 22:27:44,360
unfortunately then you have to deal with

35489
22:27:39,832 --> 22:27:44,360
all of the adversarial possibilities as

35490
22:27:48,320 --> 22:27:52,280
well oh good question could the

35491
22:27:50,192 --> 22:27:55,159
adversary potentially access things

35492
22:27:52,280 --> 22:27:57,600
sensitive like app.py theoretically no

35493
22:27:55,160 --> 22:27:58,832
like if flask itself is buggy then sure

35494
22:27:57,600 --> 22:28:00,552
maybe if you're running some other

35495
22:27:58,832 --> 22:28:03,120
software on your server on your laptop

35496
22:28:00,552 --> 22:28:04,760
then sure uh it it's possible however if

35497
22:28:03,120 --> 22:28:06,319
your server is properly configured

35498
22:28:04,760 --> 22:28:08,599
theoretically they should not be able to

35499
22:28:06,320 --> 22:28:10,160
get access to that with that said we'll

35500
22:28:08,600 --> 22:28:11,872
soon see or You might with your final

35501
22:28:10,160 --> 22:28:13,800
project if you do something web based

35502
22:28:11,872 --> 22:28:16,320
you're never going to want to write like

35503
22:28:13,800 --> 22:28:18,160
usernames and passwords in your actual

35504
22:28:16,320 --> 22:28:19,760
code you can put them in what are called

35505
22:28:18,160 --> 22:28:21,640
environment variables so sort of in the

35506
22:28:19,760 --> 22:28:24,080
computer's memory but not in your code

35507
22:28:21,640 --> 22:28:26,512
just in case you or someone screws up

35508
22:28:24,080 --> 22:28:28,640
there are uh still ways to defend

35509
22:28:26,512 --> 22:28:31,680
against those kinds of possibilities

35510
22:28:28,640 --> 22:28:31,680
however slim

35511
22:28:36,232 --> 22:28:40,320
yeah a good question and this comes back

35512
22:28:38,512 --> 22:28:42,552
to First principles just like in C and

35513
22:28:40,320 --> 22:28:45,120
in python as soon as you return from a

35514
22:28:42,552 --> 22:28:47,231
function that's it nothing below that

35515
22:28:45,120 --> 22:28:49,280
line of code executes and so to

35516
22:28:47,232 --> 22:28:51,960
summarize the question even though I'm

35517
22:28:49,280 --> 22:28:53,680
returning this failure. HTML template

35518
22:28:51,960 --> 22:28:55,480
how am I making sure we still don't

35519
22:28:53,680 --> 22:28:57,680
accidentally put volleyball in that

35520
22:28:55,480 --> 22:28:59,552
Global dictionary it's because for

35521
22:28:57,680 --> 22:29:01,480
instance if you don't give me a name on

35522
22:28:59,552 --> 22:29:04,040
line 22 at the moment I'm returning the

35523
22:29:01,480 --> 22:29:07,640
failure template and that's it lines 23

35524
22:29:04,040 --> 22:29:09,920
24 25 26 27 never execute in particular

35525
22:29:07,640 --> 22:29:11,760
26 never executes and that's where I

35526
22:29:09,920 --> 22:29:14,800
would have been saving the name

35527
22:29:11,760 --> 22:29:17,511
similarly if we do we get a invalid

35528
22:29:14,800 --> 22:29:20,040
sport that is either blank or not in the

35529
22:29:17,512 --> 22:29:22,400
original authoritative list we return

35530
22:29:20,040 --> 22:29:25,480
failure. HTML is a template in line 25

35531
22:29:22,400 --> 22:29:27,319
we never get to line 26 so it just boils

35532
22:29:25,480 --> 22:29:30,720
down to return and what that means in

35533
22:29:27,320 --> 22:29:32,080
Python 2 good question other questions

35534
22:29:30,720 --> 22:29:35,080
as

35535
22:29:32,080 --> 22:29:38,920
well no all right how about we make one

35536
22:29:35,080 --> 22:29:40,800
more enhancement here or so because the

35537
22:29:38,920 --> 22:29:45,120
problem with storing everything in this

35538
22:29:40,800 --> 22:29:48,120
Global dictionary might be what we've

35539
22:29:45,120 --> 22:29:50,480
got it all working finally but why is

35540
22:29:48,120 --> 22:29:53,760
probably a global dictionary not the

35541
22:29:50,480 --> 22:29:57,360
place to store Frost's registration

35542
22:29:53,760 --> 22:29:59,760
data what's the implication of

35543
22:29:57,360 --> 22:30:01,360
this okay might slow the whole process

35544
22:29:59,760 --> 22:30:03,192
down but that actually Ram is actually

35545
22:30:01,360 --> 22:30:05,160
good memory is actually generally a good

35546
22:30:03,192 --> 22:30:07,480
thing so not going to be a deal breaker

35547
22:30:05,160 --> 22:30:10,320
here why might I not want to store that

35548
22:30:07,480 --> 22:30:10,319
data though in that

35549
22:30:10,920 --> 22:30:15,512
variable you can perhaps infer how I fix

35550
22:30:13,800 --> 22:30:18,480
something

35551
22:30:15,512 --> 22:30:21,552
earlier yeah and

35552
22:30:18,480 --> 22:30:23,480
back yeah it gets it's the memory gets

35553
22:30:21,552 --> 22:30:25,959
deleted garbage collected if you will as

35554
22:30:23,480 --> 22:30:27,720
soon as flask stops running so if you so

35555
22:30:25,960 --> 22:30:30,120
much as hit control C like you've just

35556
22:30:27,720 --> 22:30:32,360
lost all of your freshmen who registered

35557
22:30:30,120 --> 22:30:33,871
for the sport probably not a good thing

35558
22:30:32,360 --> 22:30:36,040
I did this deliberately a moment ago and

35559
22:30:33,872 --> 22:30:38,400
I hit control C because I did want to

35560
22:30:36,040 --> 22:30:40,231
clear the dictionary but trusting that

35561
22:30:38,400 --> 22:30:41,920
your server will never crash and your

35562
22:30:40,232 --> 22:30:43,640
code will always work and the power will

35563
22:30:41,920 --> 22:30:45,319
never go out like that's not the right

35564
22:30:43,640 --> 22:30:47,040
way to build any kind of web application

35565
22:30:45,320 --> 22:30:49,080
with persistent data so what we probably

35566
22:30:47,040 --> 22:30:51,000
want to do is reintroduce csvs and we've

35567
22:30:49,080 --> 22:30:53,120
played with those in C and in Python

35568
22:30:51,000 --> 22:30:56,400
could totally use csvs but we also now

35569
22:30:53,120 --> 22:30:58,280
have p uh SQL at our disposal and let me

35570
22:30:56,400 --> 22:30:59,799
propose that we do this in SQL in

35571
22:30:58,280 --> 22:31:01,720
instead and for this let me go ahead and

35572
22:30:59,800 --> 22:31:03,440
open up a version of the program that I

35573
22:31:01,720 --> 22:31:05,192
wrote in advance so let me go ahead and

35574
22:31:03,440 --> 22:31:07,280
close these templates which will look

35575
22:31:05,192 --> 22:31:09,552
very similar but a little different from

35576
22:31:07,280 --> 22:31:12,872
the ones I wrote in advance and let me

35577
22:31:09,552 --> 22:31:15,872
go ahead and open up uh in today's let

35578
22:31:12,872 --> 22:31:19,320
me go into Source 9 let me go into Frost

35579
22:31:15,872 --> 22:31:21,232
im's how about version four technically

35580
22:31:19,320 --> 22:31:23,960
in the versions online and let me go

35581
22:31:21,232 --> 22:31:25,552
ahead and open up app.py as follows so

35582
22:31:23,960 --> 22:31:27,232
here is an already made version that

35583
22:31:25,552 --> 22:31:29,760
does just a little something different

35584
22:31:27,232 --> 22:31:31,360
at the very top I'm importing cs50 SQL

35585
22:31:29,760 --> 22:31:32,871
Library which you might recall we used a

35586
22:31:31,360 --> 22:31:34,960
couple of weeks past just to write

35587
22:31:32,872 --> 22:31:36,280
python that talks to a SQL database and

35588
22:31:34,960 --> 22:31:38,360
this feels like an opportune moment to

35589
22:31:36,280 --> 22:31:40,440
bring that idea back down here on line

35590
22:31:38,360 --> 22:31:43,600
eight I'm creating a DB variable that

35591
22:31:40,440 --> 22:31:45,600
opens up a file called frost. DB using

35592
22:31:43,600 --> 22:31:48,232
syntax that we've seen before I did

35593
22:31:45,600 --> 22:31:49,920
create this FRS DB file in advance of

35594
22:31:48,232 --> 22:31:51,440
class just so that we have a couple of

35595
22:31:49,920 --> 22:31:53,959
columns in which to store names and

35596
22:31:51,440 --> 22:31:56,232
sports and such here's that same Global

35597
22:31:53,960 --> 22:31:58,440
array a global list called Sports and

35598
22:31:56,232 --> 22:32:01,680
let's just see what's going on down

35599
22:31:58,440 --> 22:32:04,000
below if I scroll down to Index this is

35600
22:32:01,680 --> 22:32:06,231
the same as before as we wrote together

35601
22:32:04,000 --> 22:32:08,360
on the Fly let's skip deregister for a

35602
22:32:06,232 --> 22:32:10,232
moment and go now into register so this

35603
22:32:08,360 --> 22:32:11,872
one's a little different but let's see

35604
22:32:10,232 --> 22:32:13,360
what I've done I've got some comments in

35605
22:32:11,872 --> 22:32:14,872
here because I wrote it in advance and I

35606
22:32:13,360 --> 22:32:16,512
think this logic is pretty much the same

35607
22:32:14,872 --> 22:32:19,232
though I tightened it up and I'm asking

35608
22:32:16,512 --> 22:32:21,320
two questions at once using on line 38

35609
22:32:19,232 --> 22:32:22,832
the or keyword here just to say if

35610
22:32:21,320 --> 22:32:24,760
there's not a name or the sport is not

35611
22:32:22,832 --> 22:32:27,040
in sports that is what we'll call now a

35612
22:32:24,760 --> 22:32:28,680
failure but what's fun now is that on

35613
22:32:27,040 --> 22:32:31,280
line 42

35614
22:32:28,680 --> 22:32:33,799
I'm using the cs50 SQL library to

35615
22:32:31,280 --> 22:32:36,720
execute some actual SQL and I'm going to

35616
22:32:33,800 --> 22:32:39,232
insert into a table called registrant

35617
22:32:36,720 --> 22:32:41,280
two columns name and Sport what names

35618
22:32:39,232 --> 22:32:43,680
and Sport well these two values with

35619
22:32:41,280 --> 22:32:45,160
placeholders plugging in name and Sport

35620
22:32:43,680 --> 22:32:47,040
notice I'm using the question marks

35621
22:32:45,160 --> 22:32:48,960
absolutely necessary so we don't get one

35622
22:32:47,040 --> 22:32:50,680
of those SQL injection attacks because

35623
22:32:48,960 --> 22:32:52,280
that too could be possible if someone

35624
22:32:50,680 --> 22:32:54,079
typed in some dangerous words or

35625
22:32:52,280 --> 22:32:56,640
keywords like delete or single quotes or

35626
22:32:54,080 --> 22:32:59,000
semicolons in the form here I'm letting

35627
22:32:56,640 --> 22:33:00,680
the library sanitize the data and then

35628
22:32:59,000 --> 22:33:02,320
this is a trick we haven't yet seen and

35629
22:33:00,680 --> 22:33:05,159
it's really going to start tying things

35630
22:33:02,320 --> 22:33:07,480
together I can also use a redirect

35631
22:33:05,160 --> 22:33:09,320
function in flask that has the effect of

35632
22:33:07,480 --> 22:33:12,440
doing the the if you will uh

35633
22:33:09,320 --> 22:33:14,760
safetyschool.org trick again whereby

35634
22:33:12,440 --> 22:33:17,080
after the user registers if I want to

35635
22:33:14,760 --> 22:33:19,920
automatically show them now everyone who

35636
22:33:17,080 --> 22:33:21,320
is registered atreg I don't have to

35637
22:33:19,920 --> 22:33:22,872
manually expect that they'll change the

35638
22:33:21,320 --> 22:33:25,000
url like I've been doing for the past

35639
22:33:22,872 --> 22:33:27,360
few minutes I can just redirect them

35640
22:33:25,000 --> 22:33:29,160
anywhere I want on my app or heck I

35641
22:33:27,360 --> 22:33:31,160
could redirect them to any URL on the

35642
22:33:29,160 --> 22:33:32,720
internet using this function call and

35643
22:33:31,160 --> 22:33:34,600
it's just a nice way to send them to a

35644
22:33:32,720 --> 22:33:36,960
different route if you want them to see

35645
22:33:34,600 --> 22:33:39,440
in this case those registrant so let me

35646
22:33:36,960 --> 22:33:41,600
do this in the same directory let me

35647
22:33:39,440 --> 22:33:45,800
increase my terminal window size let me

35648
22:33:41,600 --> 22:33:48,512
do SQL light three of frost. DB and let

35649
22:33:45,800 --> 22:33:51,192
me type schema and you can indeed see it

35650
22:33:48,512 --> 22:33:53,872
wraps on to two lines here that each

35651
22:33:51,192 --> 22:33:55,720
registrant has an ID which will be

35652
22:33:53,872 --> 22:33:58,320
automatically assigned one two three on

35653
22:33:55,720 --> 22:34:00,192
up a name which is not null text and a

35654
22:33:58,320 --> 22:34:01,480
sport which is also the same and the

35655
22:34:00,192 --> 22:34:03,599
primary key is just going to be this

35656
22:34:01,480 --> 22:34:06,120
unique identifier so that I made in

35657
22:34:03,600 --> 22:34:08,680
advance but if I do select star from

35658
22:34:06,120 --> 22:34:11,599
registrant semicolon there's no one

35659
22:34:08,680 --> 22:34:13,400
currently registered for any sports but

35660
22:34:11,600 --> 22:34:15,760
let's try now running this let me go

35661
22:34:13,400 --> 22:34:18,480
ahead and close my old version which we

35662
22:34:15,760 --> 22:34:21,599
wrote together and I'll close that tab

35663
22:34:18,480 --> 22:34:23,912
let me do flask run in this version four

35664
22:34:21,600 --> 22:34:26,040
here all right I'm going to see some

35665
22:34:23,912 --> 22:34:27,599
similar output I'm going to open the URL

35666
22:34:26,040 --> 22:34:29,799
now and you'll see that I made a couple

35667
22:34:27,600 --> 22:34:32,400
of Chang changes before instead of using

35668
22:34:29,800 --> 22:34:34,192
a select menu I used what are called

35669
22:34:32,400 --> 22:34:35,832
radio buttons now which is a reference

35670
22:34:34,192 --> 22:34:37,720
to Old School radio buttons that were

35671
22:34:35,832 --> 22:34:39,120
mutually exclusive in cars back in the

35672
22:34:37,720 --> 22:34:40,720
day and we'll see how to do this but

35673
22:34:39,120 --> 22:34:42,552
it's just an alternative to a select

35674
22:34:40,720 --> 22:34:46,192
menu and I'm going to go ahead and type

35675
22:34:42,552 --> 22:34:48,512
in my name again here so I'll do David

35676
22:34:46,192 --> 22:34:50,440
I'll do soccer by selecting this radio

35677
22:34:48,512 --> 22:34:52,760
button and I'm going to click register

35678
22:34:50,440 --> 22:34:55,480
now and notice what happened it's a

35679
22:34:52,760 --> 22:34:57,912
little ugly the formatting but so again

35680
22:34:55,480 --> 22:35:00,912
was this 20 years ago here I have now

35681
22:34:57,912 --> 22:35:02,512
now at the slash registrant route

35682
22:35:00,912 --> 22:35:04,680
instead of an unordered list I'm just

35683
22:35:02,512 --> 22:35:06,040
using a simple HTML table so I'll show

35684
22:35:04,680 --> 22:35:07,552
you what this looks like in just a

35685
22:35:06,040 --> 22:35:09,280
moment too and I'll show you this

35686
22:35:07,552 --> 22:35:11,640
deregister button which is sort of

35687
22:35:09,280 --> 22:35:13,319
unnecessarily large I also have

35688
22:35:11,640 --> 22:35:15,720
functionality we'll soon see for how you

35689
22:35:13,320 --> 22:35:18,440
can unregister someone from a sport as

35690
22:35:15,720 --> 22:35:20,040
well so take your name out of contention

35691
22:35:18,440 --> 22:35:21,872
well let me go back to my terminal

35692
22:35:20,040 --> 22:35:24,400
window here and I'm going to click the

35693
22:35:21,872 --> 22:35:26,960
plus to give myself s a second terminal

35694
22:35:24,400 --> 22:35:31,400
so I can go back into Source 9 Frost IMS

35695
22:35:26,960 --> 22:35:33,640
4 I'm going to do SQL light of frost. DB

35696
22:35:31,400 --> 22:35:36,832
I'm going to do select star from

35697
22:35:33,640 --> 22:35:38,912
registrant now and now you'll see that

35698
22:35:36,832 --> 22:35:42,159
indeed there's David registered for

35699
22:35:38,912 --> 22:35:44,040
soccer and in fact if I quit the flask

35700
22:35:42,160 --> 22:35:46,832
program with control C and rerun it

35701
22:35:44,040 --> 22:35:48,280
again no big deal because that next

35702
22:35:46,832 --> 22:35:50,231
version of flask will just use the

35703
22:35:48,280 --> 22:35:53,160
database as well so I'm persisting

35704
22:35:50,232 --> 22:35:55,600
keeping the data in SQL light whereas

35705
22:35:53,160 --> 22:35:57,512
I'm actually grabbing it using my python

35706
22:35:55,600 --> 22:35:59,512
code in flask all right let's put one

35707
22:35:57,512 --> 22:36:03,280
more person in here so we can delete one

35708
22:35:59,512 --> 22:36:05,192
of us too Carter for basketball register

35709
22:36:03,280 --> 22:36:06,760
and now we see both of us here all right

35710
22:36:05,192 --> 22:36:08,871
so let's see how we did this let's go

35711
22:36:06,760 --> 22:36:13,360
back over to VSS code let me shrink down

35712
22:36:08,872 --> 22:36:16,160
my terminal window let me go into the

35713
22:36:13,360 --> 22:36:19,960
actually let's go into the templates

35714
22:36:16,160 --> 22:36:22,480
directory and let's look at for instance

35715
22:36:19,960 --> 22:36:25,480
index.html so previously we were using a

35716
22:36:22,480 --> 22:36:27,959
select menu turns out radio buttons use

35717
22:36:25,480 --> 22:36:30,912
the input tag but instead of having

35718
22:36:27,960 --> 22:36:32,832
input of uh type equals text like for

35719
22:36:30,912 --> 22:36:35,280
the human's name you have type equals

35720
22:36:32,832 --> 22:36:37,280
radio and so long as each of your radio

35721
22:36:35,280 --> 22:36:38,832
buttons has the same name the same name

35722
22:36:37,280 --> 22:36:41,280
the same name that's what makes them

35723
22:36:38,832 --> 22:36:43,159
mutually exclusive so checking one radio

35724
22:36:41,280 --> 22:36:45,480
button turns off the others because they

35725
22:36:43,160 --> 22:36:47,040
have the same name the value I want to

35726
22:36:45,480 --> 22:36:49,319
assign to each of these radio buttons is

35727
22:36:47,040 --> 22:36:51,000
just the sport placeholder this is what

35728
22:36:49,320 --> 22:36:52,480
the human sees on the screen so it's

35729
22:36:51,000 --> 22:36:54,280
almost the same as the select menu it

35730
22:36:52,480 --> 22:36:56,360
just looks aesthetically different but

35731
22:36:54,280 --> 22:36:57,912
there's my same button so that's all the

35732
22:36:56,360 --> 22:37:00,080
difference I made there and I added a

35733
22:36:57,912 --> 22:37:02,120
heading tag H1 just to say register to

35734
22:37:00,080 --> 22:37:06,000
make clear what it is but let's take a

35735
22:37:02,120 --> 22:37:09,871
look at another file uh this one now

35736
22:37:06,000 --> 22:37:13,320
being how about the SL registrant route

35737
22:37:09,872 --> 22:37:15,040
so if I open up registr trans. HTML here

35738
22:37:13,320 --> 22:37:17,000
now it's way more verbose than my

35739
22:37:15,040 --> 22:37:19,799
unordered list but this is just kind of

35740
22:37:17,000 --> 22:37:22,640
boring HTML here's my table tag table

35741
22:37:19,800 --> 22:37:24,832
head table row table heading this makes

35742
22:37:22,640 --> 22:37:27,280
things bold as the first row of the

35743
22:37:24,832 --> 22:37:28,959
table name sport are my two columns I've

35744
22:37:27,280 --> 22:37:31,120
got a third empty column just so I can

35745
22:37:28,960 --> 22:37:33,760
fit that button as we'll soon see again

35746
22:37:31,120 --> 22:37:35,680
T body for table body here's the same

35747
22:37:33,760 --> 22:37:37,640
for Loop trick again so that I can

35748
22:37:35,680 --> 22:37:40,159
output for every registrant a whole

35749
22:37:37,640 --> 22:37:41,760
table row and there's this weird form in

35750
22:37:40,160 --> 22:37:43,600
there but we'll come back to that but

35751
22:37:41,760 --> 22:37:46,552
there's the registrant's name there's

35752
22:37:43,600 --> 22:37:49,760
the registrant sport but notice the

35753
22:37:46,552 --> 22:37:53,192
slightly different syntax here recall

35754
22:37:49,760 --> 22:37:55,912
that cs50's select uh cs50's execute

35755
22:37:53,192 --> 22:37:58,512
function when it returns to you a list

35756
22:37:55,912 --> 22:38:00,912
of dictionaries you can then get at the

35757
22:37:58,512 --> 22:38:03,000
individual columns by way of those keys

35758
22:38:00,912 --> 22:38:05,360
so let's go to the/ registrant Route let

35759
22:38:03,000 --> 22:38:08,320
me go back to app.py scroll down here

35760
22:38:05,360 --> 22:38:11,080
and it's actually super simple here I

35761
22:38:08,320 --> 22:38:13,280
have a SL registr route that first

35762
22:38:11,080 --> 22:38:15,280
executes select star from registrant so

35763
22:38:13,280 --> 22:38:17,552
just old SQL stuff give me everyone from

35764
22:38:15,280 --> 22:38:19,872
the registr table let me then render the

35765
22:38:17,552 --> 22:38:23,080
template called registr trans. HTML and

35766
22:38:19,872 --> 22:38:24,480
just pass in this list of dictionaries

35767
22:38:23,080 --> 22:38:27,680
and we haven't quite done this yet but

35768
22:38:24,480 --> 22:38:30,552
if you go back to register. HTML how do

35769
22:38:27,680 --> 22:38:32,552
you iterate over each dictionary in that

35770
22:38:30,552 --> 22:38:34,832
list well the syntax is just for

35771
22:38:32,552 --> 22:38:37,832
registrant in registrants that makes

35772
22:38:34,832 --> 22:38:40,599
this a dictionary one at a time in the

35773
22:38:37,832 --> 22:38:42,360
list just like in Python so registrant

35774
22:38:40,600 --> 22:38:44,872
name and registrants sport is just

35775
22:38:42,360 --> 22:38:47,120
another Syntax for using the square

35776
22:38:44,872 --> 22:38:49,680
bracket notation it's just a little

35777
22:38:47,120 --> 22:38:51,280
cleaner and slightly more succinct than

35778
22:38:49,680 --> 22:38:53,040
having quotes and square brackets

35779
22:38:51,280 --> 22:38:54,360
everywhere and then the rest of this is

35780
22:38:53,040 --> 22:38:58,599
just

35781
22:38:54,360 --> 22:38:59,912
HTML so what happens now if I want to uh

35782
22:38:58,600 --> 22:39:01,912
like Carter has been cut from the

35783
22:38:59,912 --> 22:39:03,800
basketball team if you will so how do we

35784
22:39:01,912 --> 22:39:06,872
do that well we want to click this

35785
22:39:03,800 --> 22:39:08,800
button deregister next to Carter's name

35786
22:39:06,872 --> 22:39:10,552
but how does this work and think about

35787
22:39:08,800 --> 22:39:12,832
now any website you visited that has

35788
22:39:10,552 --> 22:39:14,552
something like a shopping cart uh where

35789
22:39:12,832 --> 22:39:17,000
you can remove things from your cart or

35790
22:39:14,552 --> 22:39:18,552
update quantities or add more quantities

35791
22:39:17,000 --> 22:39:20,480
to your shopping cart on Amazon or

35792
22:39:18,552 --> 22:39:23,360
anything else well let's actually look

35793
22:39:20,480 --> 22:39:25,280
at the HTML that my app has spit out

35794
22:39:23,360 --> 22:39:27,960
let's actually look at this here and

35795
22:39:25,280 --> 22:39:30,360
we'll see the following we'll see that

35796
22:39:27,960 --> 22:39:33,192
we have here in the HTML that reached

35797
22:39:30,360 --> 22:39:35,720
the user not only is David in the first

35798
22:39:33,192 --> 22:39:38,640
column socer in the second notice that

35799
22:39:35,720 --> 22:39:41,512
my register. HTML form is also spitting

35800
22:39:38,640 --> 22:39:43,512
out a tiny little web form of its own

35801
22:39:41,512 --> 22:39:45,760
it's ugly but I only care about its

35802
22:39:43,512 --> 22:39:48,640
functionality for now and notice what

35803
22:39:45,760 --> 22:39:51,120
I'm doing here every registrant in this

35804
22:39:48,640 --> 22:39:53,832
database gets their very own deregister

35805
22:39:51,120 --> 22:39:56,360
button and that form has a button that

35806
22:39:53,832 --> 22:39:58,231
says deregister but notice what else

35807
22:39:56,360 --> 22:39:59,960
each of those forms have there's no text

35808
22:39:58,232 --> 22:40:04,480
box there's no drop down menu there's no

35809
22:39:59,960 --> 22:40:07,720
radio buttons rather you have a hidden

35810
22:40:04,480 --> 22:40:10,512
input field here so there is a way with

35811
22:40:07,720 --> 22:40:12,280
HTML to have a form that will submit

35812
22:40:10,512 --> 22:40:14,360
information but you don't have to give

35813
22:40:12,280 --> 22:40:16,760
the user the ability to change that

35814
22:40:14,360 --> 22:40:18,872
information you can just go ahead and

35815
22:40:16,760 --> 22:40:21,599
tuck it inside of the form invisibly if

35816
22:40:18,872 --> 22:40:23,232
you will hidden in fashion and so what's

35817
22:40:21,600 --> 22:40:26,040
going to happen is if I click the D

35818
22:40:23,232 --> 22:40:28,120
register button next to Carter his

35819
22:40:26,040 --> 22:40:30,959
primary key is two

35820
22:40:28,120 --> 22:40:33,192
mine is instead one so what's going to

35821
22:40:30,960 --> 22:40:37,400
happen if I click his deregister button

35822
22:40:33,192 --> 22:40:40,912
it submits a form with a

35823
22:40:37,400 --> 22:40:43,120
ID parameter whose value is two and it

35824
22:40:40,912 --> 22:40:44,680
submits it to the deregister route so

35825
22:40:43,120 --> 22:40:47,231
what do that mean well if I go to VSS

35826
22:40:44,680 --> 22:40:50,439
code and I go to app.py let's look at

35827
22:40:47,232 --> 22:40:52,872
the deregister route that I skipped over

35828
22:40:50,440 --> 22:40:56,680
so if you access the deregister route

35829
22:40:52,872 --> 22:40:58,912
via post this code gets called I grab

35830
22:40:56,680 --> 22:41:01,400
from request form the ID that was

35831
22:40:58,912 --> 22:41:03,280
submitted in Hidden fashion if there's

35832
22:41:01,400 --> 22:41:05,231
indeed an ID that is it's not blank it's

35833
22:41:03,280 --> 22:41:08,872
not zero it's an actual number like one

35834
22:41:05,232 --> 22:41:12,280
2 three or more I execute delete from

35835
22:41:08,872 --> 22:41:13,960
registrant where ID equals that value

35836
22:41:12,280 --> 22:41:16,192
with a question mark Place holder and

35837
22:41:13,960 --> 22:41:18,832
then I redirect the user back to

35838
22:41:16,192 --> 22:41:21,080
registrant now if I go back to this form

35839
22:41:18,832 --> 22:41:24,231
here I click deregister we'll see that

35840
22:41:21,080 --> 22:41:26,872
in action gone is now Carter and in fact

35841
22:41:24,232 --> 22:41:30,720
if I go back to my terminal window here

35842
22:41:26,872 --> 22:41:33,040
I open open up uh SQL light 3 of frost.

35843
22:41:30,720 --> 22:41:36,360
DB and rerun select star from registrant

35844
22:41:33,040 --> 22:41:39,231
Carter is now gone so again using very

35845
22:41:36,360 --> 22:41:41,232
simple HTML forms you can get buttons

35846
22:41:39,232 --> 22:41:43,320
and links and other such UI mechanisms

35847
22:41:41,232 --> 22:41:46,280
to like do things on the server that you

35848
22:41:43,320 --> 22:41:48,280
want but there is a danger here this now

35849
22:41:46,280 --> 22:41:50,640
is really meant this example is like an

35850
22:41:48,280 --> 22:41:53,232
administrative website like it was some

35851
22:41:50,640 --> 22:41:56,400
20 years ago just for us internal staff

35852
22:41:53,232 --> 22:41:58,800
to be doing things technically this is

35853
22:41:56,400 --> 22:42:02,552
dangerous what I've just done

35854
22:41:58,800 --> 22:42:05,080
two even though Carter's ID is two and

35855
22:42:02,552 --> 22:42:06,912
hidden and mine is one in Hidden what

35856
22:42:05,080 --> 22:42:10,640
could this allow an adversary to do if

35857
22:42:06,912 --> 22:42:10,640
they had admin access to the same

35858
22:42:11,480 --> 22:42:16,080
site any

35859
22:42:14,232 --> 22:42:18,232
thoughts

35860
22:42:16,080 --> 22:42:20,720
yeah

35861
22:42:18,232 --> 22:42:22,552
yeah yeah they could change the value of

35862
22:42:20,720 --> 22:42:24,360
that hidden attri by opening up chrom's

35863
22:42:22,552 --> 22:42:26,159
like developer tools change the number

35864
22:42:24,360 --> 22:42:28,320
in the HTML they could delete anyone

35865
22:42:26,160 --> 22:42:31,080
deregister anyone want from the database

35866
22:42:28,320 --> 22:42:32,640
now in this case I claim this is fine

35867
22:42:31,080 --> 22:42:34,680
because this is only meant for us staff

35868
22:42:32,640 --> 22:42:36,800
who were running Sports back in the day

35869
22:42:34,680 --> 22:42:39,040
but it's indeed a risk so wouldn't it be

35870
22:42:36,800 --> 22:42:41,912
nice if we could actually ensure that

35871
22:42:39,040 --> 22:42:44,511
only those users who are authorized are

35872
22:42:41,912 --> 22:42:46,912
allowed to execute certain actions I

35873
22:42:44,512 --> 22:42:49,440
think for this capability we're actually

35874
22:42:46,912 --> 22:42:51,912
going to need to introduce something a

35875
22:42:49,440 --> 22:42:53,872
bit more and so here of course is an

35876
22:42:51,912 --> 22:42:55,832
opportunity to talk briefly about really

35877
22:42:53,872 --> 22:42:58,040
what you and I do all day long every day

35878
22:42:55,832 --> 22:43:00,231
we log into one or more websites or apps

35879
22:42:58,040 --> 22:43:01,719
or at least until uh you're logged out

35880
22:43:00,232 --> 22:43:02,912
automatically and you have to do it

35881
22:43:01,720 --> 22:43:04,760
again so here for instance is a

35882
22:43:02,912 --> 22:43:06,319
screenshot of Gmail when you type in

35883
22:43:04,760 --> 22:43:08,319
your username you type in your password

35884
22:43:06,320 --> 22:43:10,192
maybe your to factor code that gets

35885
22:43:08,320 --> 22:43:12,080
texted or sent to your phone then you're

35886
22:43:10,192 --> 22:43:13,832
logged in and thankfully you're not

35887
22:43:12,080 --> 22:43:16,640
prompted to log in again typically for

35888
22:43:13,832 --> 22:43:18,280
number of hours or days or weeks

35889
22:43:16,640 --> 22:43:20,360
depending on the website like Gmail

35890
22:43:18,280 --> 22:43:22,400
keeps you logged in for ages your bank

35891
22:43:20,360 --> 22:43:24,600
probably logs you out within an hour or

35892
22:43:22,400 --> 22:43:26,832
so for safety sake so that is completely

35893
22:43:24,600 --> 22:43:29,512
configurable on the server but how does

35894
22:43:26,832 --> 22:43:31,280
g Emil know how does Google know that

35895
22:43:29,512 --> 22:43:33,000
even as you're checking different mails

35896
22:43:31,280 --> 22:43:34,680
again and again and again how do they

35897
22:43:33,000 --> 22:43:37,192
know that you're still the same person

35898
22:43:34,680 --> 22:43:38,959
who logged in well it turns out that

35899
22:43:37,192 --> 22:43:42,319
using these same building blocks as

35900
22:43:38,960 --> 22:43:44,832
today HTTP and HTML and more you can

35901
22:43:42,320 --> 22:43:47,480
actually implement the notion of a login

35902
22:43:44,832 --> 22:43:49,912
feature by doing the equivalent of

35903
22:43:47,480 --> 22:43:51,319
something with something called cookies

35904
22:43:49,912 --> 22:43:53,160
essentially what happens when you first

35905
22:43:51,320 --> 22:43:55,000
log into a website for the very first

35906
22:43:53,160 --> 22:43:57,360
time successfully with your username and

35907
22:43:55,000 --> 22:43:59,192
password a cookie so to speak is planted

35908
22:43:57,360 --> 22:44:01,160
on your computer and metaphorically this

35909
22:43:59,192 --> 22:44:03,159
is kind of like taking a hand stamp and

35910
22:44:01,160 --> 22:44:05,832
your hand is now stamped in this case a

35911
22:44:03,160 --> 22:44:07,680
smiley face so that every other time you

35912
22:44:05,832 --> 22:44:09,720
click on a link on that same website

35913
22:44:07,680 --> 22:44:11,832
google.com gmail.com whatever

35914
22:44:09,720 --> 22:44:13,640
unbeknownst to you your browser is

35915
22:44:11,832 --> 22:44:15,192
constantly presenting that handstamp

35916
22:44:13,640 --> 22:44:17,000
just like going into a club or an

35917
22:44:15,192 --> 22:44:18,231
amusement park or something like that

35918
22:44:17,000 --> 22:44:19,160
where they don't want to check your ID

35919
22:44:18,232 --> 22:44:20,480
again they don't want to check your

35920
22:44:19,160 --> 22:44:23,320
ticket again they just want to quickly

35921
22:44:20,480 --> 22:44:24,832
see the same hand stamp and so that is

35922
22:44:23,320 --> 22:44:26,552
one of the things that a browser is

35923
22:44:24,832 --> 22:44:29,000
always doing for you once you're logged

35924
22:44:26,552 --> 22:44:31,552
in any cookies that have been planted so

35925
22:44:29,000 --> 22:44:33,912
to speak in your Mac or PC or phone are

35926
22:44:31,552 --> 22:44:35,912
constantly represented to the site every

35927
22:44:33,912 --> 22:44:38,640
time you click a link or make another

35928
22:44:35,912 --> 22:44:40,160
request to that website and mechanically

35929
22:44:38,640 --> 22:44:42,720
how this works not just metaphorically

35930
22:44:40,160 --> 22:44:45,552
and ink essentially this is what happens

35931
22:44:42,720 --> 22:44:47,912
here is a example of an HTTP request to

35932
22:44:45,552 --> 22:44:50,192
something like Gmail and suppose for

35933
22:44:47,912 --> 22:44:52,400
instance that you've logged in typically

35934
22:44:50,192 --> 22:44:54,319
as of last week we said that coming back

35935
22:44:52,400 --> 22:44:56,439
from the server would be another virtual

35936
22:44:54,320 --> 22:44:58,440
envelope containing like a 200 okay

35937
22:44:56,440 --> 22:45:00,232
message and then like the actual web

35938
22:44:58,440 --> 22:45:03,440
page or the picture of a cat or whatever

35939
22:45:00,232 --> 22:45:05,280
it may be but Google can also if they

35940
22:45:03,440 --> 22:45:07,320
verified that you have some username and

35941
22:45:05,280 --> 22:45:09,720
password correctly inputed they can do

35942
22:45:07,320 --> 22:45:11,552
the equivalent of stamping your hand and

35943
22:45:09,720 --> 22:45:13,872
the way they do this is they send an

35944
22:45:11,552 --> 22:45:16,440
additional line of text in that virtual

35945
22:45:13,872 --> 22:45:20,192
envelope from the server to your browser

35946
22:45:16,440 --> 22:45:22,512
literally using another HTTP header not

35947
22:45:20,192 --> 22:45:24,480
content type which just mundanely tells

35948
22:45:22,512 --> 22:45:27,640
you what kind of content has come back

35949
22:45:24,480 --> 22:45:31,000
they literally send an http header

35950
22:45:27,640 --> 22:45:33,720
called set-cookie and then they set a

35951
22:45:31,000 --> 22:45:35,760
key value pair on your Mac or PC this is

35952
22:45:33,720 --> 22:45:38,480
the technical equivalent of this smiley

35953
22:45:35,760 --> 22:45:40,319
face handstamp and what your computer is

35954
22:45:38,480 --> 22:45:43,280
designed to do because your computer and

35955
22:45:40,320 --> 22:45:46,000
intern browser are supposed to implement

35956
22:45:43,280 --> 22:45:48,040
HTTP anytime you click another link on

35957
22:45:46,000 --> 22:45:50,160
Gmail or click on another mail or the

35958
22:45:48,040 --> 22:45:52,159
like your browser unbeknownst to you

35959
22:45:50,160 --> 22:45:54,400
presents that handstamp and how it does

35960
22:45:52,160 --> 22:45:57,120
it technically is in the envelope it

35961
22:45:54,400 --> 22:45:59,360
sends to Google from your browser it

35962
22:45:57,120 --> 22:46:02,760
doesn't send set cookie it just sends

35963
22:45:59,360 --> 22:46:04,640
cookie colon and the exact same thing

35964
22:46:02,760 --> 22:46:07,640
and so long as Google is smart and they

35965
22:46:04,640 --> 22:46:09,680
have a database or something of all of

35966
22:46:07,640 --> 22:46:11,680
the session Valu session is the

35967
22:46:09,680 --> 22:46:14,231
technical term for this maintenance of

35968
22:46:11,680 --> 22:46:15,832
information across HTTP so long as

35969
22:46:14,232 --> 22:46:18,040
Google has a big database that knows

35970
22:46:15,832 --> 22:46:21,599
that my cookie value is one 123 and your

35971
22:46:18,040 --> 22:46:25,192
cookie value is 456 they can infer from

35972
22:46:21,600 --> 22:46:27,680
this virtual handstamp whose emails they

35973
22:46:25,192 --> 22:46:29,319
should be showing mine or yours or the

35974
22:46:27,680 --> 22:46:31,319
like so this is just scratching the

35975
22:46:29,320 --> 22:46:34,872
surface but if I really wanted to enable

35976
22:46:31,320 --> 22:46:36,680
only Carter to deregister himself I just

35977
22:46:34,872 --> 22:46:38,440
have to make sure that I log him in

35978
22:46:36,680 --> 22:46:41,000
somehow username password and all of

35979
22:46:38,440 --> 22:46:43,600
that I stamp his hand or really put a

35980
22:46:41,000 --> 22:46:46,120
cookie on his computer and only if his

35981
22:46:43,600 --> 22:46:48,512
cookie lines up with the user ID he's

35982
22:46:46,120 --> 22:46:51,832
trying to deregister should he be

35983
22:46:48,512 --> 22:46:53,192
allowed to in fact do so so all of this

35984
22:46:51,832 --> 22:46:55,231
is quite possible and indeed the

35985
22:46:53,192 --> 22:46:56,552
technical term for this is session and

35986
22:46:55,232 --> 22:46:59,512
what we thought we'd do in our remaining

35987
22:46:56,552 --> 22:47:01,231
time Today show you some examples of

35988
22:46:59,512 --> 22:47:03,400
exactly how some of the most familiar

35989
22:47:01,232 --> 22:47:05,440
web functionality is implemented today

35990
22:47:03,400 --> 22:47:07,832
some of which you'll use in your own uh

35991
22:47:05,440 --> 22:47:09,640
problem set 9 uh which itself will be a

35992
22:47:07,832 --> 22:47:11,720
web app or perhaps even your final

35993
22:47:09,640 --> 22:47:13,680
project so let me go ahead and do this

35994
22:47:11,720 --> 22:47:16,192
let me close my previous tabs and all

35995
22:47:13,680 --> 22:47:18,912
things for ashs and let's move on to

35996
22:47:16,192 --> 22:47:20,400
implementing some notion of login so in

35997
22:47:18,912 --> 22:47:23,760
just a moment I'll switch over here to

35998
22:47:20,400 --> 22:47:25,511
VSS code and what I'm going to do is

35999
22:47:23,760 --> 22:47:27,680
indeed in my source 9 directory I'm

36000
22:47:25,512 --> 22:47:30,640
going to go into a login directory and

36001
22:47:27,680 --> 22:47:32,799
if I type LS here you'll see app.py

36002
22:47:30,640 --> 22:47:34,232
requirements. text which just refers to

36003
22:47:32,800 --> 22:47:36,960
libraries I want to automatically

36004
22:47:34,232 --> 22:47:38,120
install and a templates folder as well

36005
22:47:36,960 --> 22:47:39,760
I'm going to go ahead and stop the

36006
22:47:38,120 --> 22:47:41,512
previous server and close that terminal

36007
22:47:39,760 --> 22:47:42,599
window and I'm going to open up this

36008
22:47:41,512 --> 22:47:45,400
version of

36009
22:47:42,600 --> 22:47:46,800
app.py so there's a few new lines here

36010
22:47:45,400 --> 22:47:48,640
and we'll give you these lines for

36011
22:47:46,800 --> 22:47:50,400
problems at nine but I've got some of

36012
22:47:48,640 --> 22:47:52,720
the familiar stuff up here including

36013
22:47:50,400 --> 22:47:54,912
this new redirect function we just used

36014
22:47:52,720 --> 22:47:57,120
and I have a session variable that comes

36015
22:47:54,912 --> 22:47:58,959
with flask 2 so what's nice again about

36016
22:47:57,120 --> 22:48:01,280
flask is that it deals with all of this

36017
22:47:58,960 --> 22:48:03,640
cookie stuff for you it sets the cookie

36018
22:48:01,280 --> 22:48:06,160
it checks the cookie and what flask does

36019
22:48:03,640 --> 22:48:09,080
for you is it gives you the abstraction

36020
22:48:06,160 --> 22:48:11,280
of a variable called session so that

36021
22:48:09,080 --> 22:48:13,360
anything you put in the session variable

36022
22:48:11,280 --> 22:48:15,440
which itself is a dictionary will be

36023
22:48:13,360 --> 22:48:17,512
there again and again and again whenever

36024
22:48:15,440 --> 22:48:19,512
that same user comes back a session is

36025
22:48:17,512 --> 22:48:22,800
how you implement essentially like the

36026
22:48:19,512 --> 22:48:24,552
proverbial shopping cart uh if I'm

36027
22:48:22,800 --> 22:48:27,000
logged into Amazon you're logged into

36028
22:48:24,552 --> 22:48:29,760
Amazon Amazon knows which of us is which

36029
22:48:27,000 --> 22:48:31,720
by way of that cookie and Amazon if

36030
22:48:29,760 --> 22:48:33,319
they're using flask provides the

36031
22:48:31,720 --> 22:48:35,512
programmer with a dictionary called

36032
22:48:33,320 --> 22:48:37,760
session and flasks make sure that when

36033
22:48:35,512 --> 22:48:39,720
Carter is visiting the site the code

36034
22:48:37,760 --> 22:48:42,120
uses his session object when I'm

36035
22:48:39,720 --> 22:48:43,680
visiting the site it uses my session

36036
22:48:42,120 --> 22:48:45,552
object but it's all implemented with

36037
22:48:43,680 --> 22:48:47,680
those same cookies this is the same as

36038
22:48:45,552 --> 22:48:49,720
before these lines are new and you'll

36039
22:48:47,680 --> 22:48:52,552
see these in problem Set n this is how

36040
22:48:49,720 --> 22:48:53,912
we enable sessions in a web application

36041
22:48:52,552 --> 22:48:55,720
and I'll just wave my hands at the

36042
22:48:53,912 --> 22:48:57,400
detail there's different ways to

36043
22:48:55,720 --> 22:48:59,160
implement sessions whether you use

36044
22:48:57,400 --> 22:49:01,079
cookies on the server cookies on the

36045
22:48:59,160 --> 22:49:03,000
browser or other things these just

36046
22:49:01,080 --> 22:49:05,480
ensure that we're storing the the

36047
22:49:03,000 --> 22:49:08,232
session information the shopping cart on

36048
22:49:05,480 --> 22:49:10,872
the server itself now down here let's go

36049
22:49:08,232 --> 22:49:14,360
ahead and do this let's go ahead and run

36050
22:49:10,872 --> 22:49:17,192
flask run so I can see what this app

36051
22:49:14,360 --> 22:49:19,552
does if I do this and visit the URL that

36052
22:49:17,192 --> 22:49:21,599
gets outputed you'll see a very simple

36053
22:49:19,552 --> 22:49:23,192
web page here and if I type in for

36054
22:49:21,600 --> 22:49:25,800
instance my name I'm not going to bother

36055
22:49:23,192 --> 22:49:28,319
with a password and click log in you'll

36056
22:49:25,800 --> 22:49:30,232
see that you are logged in as David and

36057
22:49:28,320 --> 22:49:32,680
now I can log out so I'm going to go

36058
22:49:30,232 --> 22:49:35,040
ahead and click log out and now it seems

36059
22:49:32,680 --> 22:49:36,359
to know that I'm not logged in again I

36060
22:49:35,040 --> 22:49:37,832
can log in as Carter because I didn't

36061
22:49:36,360 --> 22:49:39,760
bother implementing passwords for

36062
22:49:37,832 --> 22:49:41,912
Simplicity but now the site knows I'm

36063
22:49:39,760 --> 22:49:44,231
logged in as Carter better yet if I

36064
22:49:41,912 --> 22:49:46,480
reload reload reload or click this

36065
22:49:44,232 --> 22:49:49,760
button again and again notice it still

36066
22:49:46,480 --> 22:49:52,480
knows that I'm Carter uh until such time

36067
22:49:49,760 --> 22:49:54,400
as I log out all right well how is this

36068
22:49:52,480 --> 22:49:57,192
working well let's go back to vs code

36069
22:49:54,400 --> 22:49:59,040
here and let me scroll down to first

36070
22:49:57,192 --> 22:50:01,552
this route this is a very common

36071
22:49:59,040 --> 22:50:05,000
Paradigm here whereby I'm checking for

36072
22:50:01,552 --> 22:50:07,872
the index route if there is not a name

36073
22:50:05,000 --> 22:50:09,912
in the session redirect the user to SL

36074
22:50:07,872 --> 22:50:13,160
login now what does that mean well let

36075
22:50:09,912 --> 22:50:15,800
me go back to vs code here let me go to

36076
22:50:13,160 --> 22:50:17,000
the slash route so again your url will

36077
22:50:15,800 --> 22:50:19,360
be different but I'm just going to go to

36078
22:50:17,000 --> 22:50:21,760
slash and hit enter notice that I got

36079
22:50:19,360 --> 22:50:23,440
automatically redirected to login and so

36080
22:50:21,760 --> 22:50:24,799
many websites do this if you go to a

36081
22:50:23,440 --> 22:50:27,872
website and you're not logged in you're

36082
22:50:24,800 --> 22:50:29,232
very often redirected to SL login or SL

36083
22:50:27,872 --> 22:50:31,832
account or something like that where

36084
22:50:29,232 --> 22:50:33,960
you're prompted the code for doing that

36085
22:50:31,832 --> 22:50:35,231
is right here if there's no name in the

36086
22:50:33,960 --> 22:50:37,720
session if there's no name in the

36087
22:50:35,232 --> 22:50:40,600
shopping cart if you will go ahead and

36088
22:50:37,720 --> 22:50:42,552
return the user to login that route

36089
22:50:40,600 --> 22:50:45,320
otherwise implicitly if they are logged

36090
22:50:42,552 --> 22:50:47,720
in show them index.html so let's go down

36091
22:50:45,320 --> 22:50:49,960
that rabbit hole let me open up in VSS

36092
22:50:47,720 --> 22:50:52,552
code a second terminal window let me go

36093
22:50:49,960 --> 22:50:55,872
into Source 9 and go into this same

36094
22:50:52,552 --> 22:50:58,040
login demonstration and let me open up

36095
22:50:55,872 --> 22:51:00,192
the template called

36096
22:50:58,040 --> 22:51:01,719
index.html and here's all this is

36097
22:51:00,192 --> 22:51:03,192
there's some layout but who cares at

36098
22:51:01,720 --> 22:51:06,440
this point it's just the boiler plate

36099
22:51:03,192 --> 22:51:08,912
generic HTML here's the body block I

36100
22:51:06,440 --> 22:51:12,600
have this and this two is ginger because

36101
22:51:08,912 --> 22:51:14,912
of the curly brace and the percent sign

36102
22:51:12,600 --> 22:51:17,160
if there's a name in the session this is

36103
22:51:14,912 --> 22:51:19,599
just python syntax then say this

36104
22:51:17,160 --> 22:51:21,360
sentence you are logged in as whatever

36105
22:51:19,600 --> 22:51:22,960
name is in the session in the shopping

36106
22:51:21,360 --> 22:51:25,832
cart if you will and then I just have

36107
22:51:22,960 --> 22:51:28,400
this HTML link for logging the user out

36108
22:51:25,832 --> 22:51:30,480
else if there is no name in the session

36109
22:51:28,400 --> 22:51:32,480
logically just say you are not logged in

36110
22:51:30,480 --> 22:51:34,872
and give them a manual link for logging

36111
22:51:32,480 --> 22:51:37,680
in instead so that's all this particular

36112
22:51:34,872 --> 22:51:40,080
template does but how does the slash

36113
22:51:37,680 --> 22:51:42,599
login work well let's go into this other

36114
22:51:40,080 --> 22:51:45,232
template code of login. HTML to which

36115
22:51:42,600 --> 22:51:47,320
I'm redirected super simple this is just

36116
22:51:45,232 --> 22:51:48,912
copy paste from HTML before I've got a

36117
22:51:47,320 --> 22:51:51,080
login form that's going to have an

36118
22:51:48,912 --> 22:51:54,120
action of Slash login submits for

36119
22:51:51,080 --> 22:51:56,040
privacy sake just via post and then the

36120
22:51:54,120 --> 22:51:57,480
rest of this is just a simple form and

36121
22:51:56,040 --> 22:51:59,000
I'm using using an input type equals

36122
22:51:57,480 --> 22:52:01,280
submit instead of button equals type

36123
22:51:59,000 --> 22:52:03,192
equals submit but same idea here too and

36124
22:52:01,280 --> 22:52:06,280
if I go back to app.py well let's see

36125
22:52:03,192 --> 22:52:07,959
how login works all right it's a lot all

36126
22:52:06,280 --> 22:52:10,400
at once but they're relatively simple

36127
22:52:07,960 --> 22:52:14,400
reapplications of the same idea so if

36128
22:52:10,400 --> 22:52:17,511
the user visits SL login via get or post

36129
22:52:14,400 --> 22:52:19,231
call this function login if the user has

36130
22:52:17,512 --> 22:52:21,680
submitted via post and we saw this

36131
22:52:19,232 --> 22:52:25,360
technique before go ahead and do this on

36132
22:52:21,680 --> 22:52:28,719
line 23 store in this special session

36133
22:52:25,360 --> 22:52:32,760
variable that comes with flask a name

36134
22:52:28,720 --> 22:52:34,512
key and store in it the user's own name

36135
22:52:32,760 --> 22:52:36,680
so quote unquote name will have a value

36136
22:52:34,512 --> 22:52:38,800
of David or Carter or the like and as

36137
22:52:36,680 --> 22:52:40,799
soon as you do that redirect the user

36138
22:52:38,800 --> 22:52:42,680
back to slash just so they see the

36139
22:52:40,800 --> 22:52:44,832
homepage again and this is how Amazon

36140
22:52:42,680 --> 22:52:46,760
and all these other websites work too

36141
22:52:44,832 --> 22:52:48,599
otherwise if they visit this page

36142
22:52:46,760 --> 22:52:50,959
implicitly via get and even though I

36143
22:52:48,600 --> 22:52:52,400
didn't say equals equals get anywhere

36144
22:52:50,960 --> 22:52:54,320
that's sort of the implication because

36145
22:52:52,400 --> 22:52:56,400
if you can only get here via get or post

36146
22:52:54,320 --> 22:52:58,400
and we already handled post logically

36147
22:52:56,400 --> 22:53:01,079
All That Remains is get well then just

36148
22:52:58,400 --> 22:53:02,680
show them the login screen instead but

36149
22:53:01,080 --> 22:53:05,360
there's half a dozen ways we could

36150
22:53:02,680 --> 22:53:07,280
express that same logic and then for log

36151
22:53:05,360 --> 22:53:09,232
out this is kind of straightforward if

36152
22:53:07,280 --> 22:53:11,959
the user clicks that log out link and

36153
22:53:09,232 --> 22:53:14,832
ends up at SL logout this route well

36154
22:53:11,960 --> 22:53:18,040
just change the value of that key in the

36155
22:53:14,832 --> 22:53:20,231
session to be none effectively no Carter

36156
22:53:18,040 --> 22:53:23,599
is gone David's gone there's no one

36157
22:53:20,232 --> 22:53:25,000
logged in so that is all that's required

36158
22:53:23,600 --> 22:53:26,720
to actually implement the notion of

36159
22:53:25,000 --> 22:53:27,960
logging in and logging out of website

36160
22:53:26,720 --> 22:53:29,552
plus the password thing which should

36161
22:53:27,960 --> 22:53:31,680
probably involve a database but one

36162
22:53:29,552 --> 22:53:33,159
thing at a time and really session is

36163
22:53:31,680 --> 22:53:35,832
sort of like the code version of a

36164
22:53:33,160 --> 22:53:38,160
shopping cart whereby if I visit the

36165
22:53:35,832 --> 22:53:39,720
same code I get my own session object if

36166
22:53:38,160 --> 22:53:41,720
Carter visits the website he gets his

36167
22:53:39,720 --> 22:53:44,512
own session object and the way flask

36168
22:53:41,720 --> 22:53:46,832
Keeps Us straight is they put one cookie

36169
22:53:44,512 --> 22:53:49,552
on my computer a different cookie on his

36170
22:53:46,832 --> 22:53:51,832
computer and uses those to line up with

36171
22:53:49,552 --> 22:53:54,120
making sure the right session gets shown

36172
22:53:51,832 --> 22:54:00,360
to the right actual

36173
22:53:54,120 --> 22:54:00,360
user questions on this notion of

36174
22:54:00,912 --> 22:54:05,760
sessions no all right how about a couple

36175
22:54:03,600 --> 22:54:08,080
final examples just to tie this all

36176
22:54:05,760 --> 22:54:10,599
together let me go back into vs code

36177
22:54:08,080 --> 22:54:13,512
here let me quit my previous version of

36178
22:54:10,600 --> 22:54:15,600
flask let's go into Source 9 and go into

36179
22:54:13,512 --> 22:54:16,960
store which is a separate app Al

36180
22:54:15,600 --> 22:54:19,040
together and let's start by just running

36181
22:54:16,960 --> 22:54:21,760
flask to see what it does let's hover

36182
22:54:19,040 --> 22:54:23,871
over the URL and open it in another Tab

36183
22:54:21,760 --> 22:54:27,192
and this is pretty ugly too let me zoom

36184
22:54:23,872 --> 22:54:29,232
in but it's a very simple bookstore like

36185
22:54:27,192 --> 22:54:31,440
an early amazon.com for each of these

36186
22:54:29,232 --> 22:54:33,872
seven books here Each of which seems to

36187
22:54:31,440 --> 22:54:36,160
be like maybe this is H1 this is H2 H2

36188
22:54:33,872 --> 22:54:38,232
H2 H2 and then there's a button

36189
22:54:36,160 --> 22:54:40,600
underneath each well now let's use this

36190
22:54:38,232 --> 22:54:42,552
as an opportunity to kind of infer like

36191
22:54:40,600 --> 22:54:44,912
for any website how this thing works let

36192
22:54:42,552 --> 22:54:46,720
me go ahead and do view page source and

36193
22:54:44,912 --> 22:54:49,040
you can do this for any website on the

36194
22:54:46,720 --> 22:54:51,760
internet let's try to figure out how

36195
22:54:49,040 --> 22:54:54,231
this bookstore adds things to a cart

36196
22:54:51,760 --> 22:54:56,599
well here's the H1 tag uninteresting H2

36197
22:54:54,232 --> 22:55:00,192
H2 H2 so the juicy part is in these

36198
22:54:56,600 --> 22:55:02,232
forms each of these forms has an action

36199
22:55:00,192 --> 22:55:03,760
of SL cart so that's the route that's

36200
22:55:02,232 --> 22:55:06,600
going to be interesting in a moment and

36201
22:55:03,760 --> 22:55:08,959
it uses post for privacy sake each of

36202
22:55:06,600 --> 22:55:12,400
these forms like the deregister feature

36203
22:55:08,960 --> 22:55:15,232
for Carter has an ID attribute an ID

36204
22:55:12,400 --> 22:55:18,079
parameter that's hidden visually that

36205
22:55:15,232 --> 22:55:21,080
has a value of one or two or three so

36206
22:55:18,080 --> 22:55:22,760
like the unique uh uh like barcodes for

36207
22:55:21,080 --> 22:55:24,552
the books if you will but super small

36208
22:55:22,760 --> 22:55:26,319
numbers in our case and then each of

36209
22:55:24,552 --> 22:55:28,640
these other forms just had each of these

36210
22:55:26,320 --> 22:55:31,232
other books has an identical form except

36211
22:55:28,640 --> 22:55:33,319
for the value of this year now in this

36212
22:55:31,232 --> 22:55:35,800
case this isn't such a big deal that a

36213
22:55:33,320 --> 22:55:38,080
user could technically hack the HTML of

36214
22:55:35,800 --> 22:55:39,720
this bookstore amazon.com and change the

36215
22:55:38,080 --> 22:55:41,640
IDS because whoa what's the worst

36216
22:55:39,720 --> 22:55:43,600
they're going to do like buy more books

36217
22:55:41,640 --> 22:55:45,280
by adding more IDs to their shopping

36218
22:55:43,600 --> 22:55:47,160
cart like that's not a problem there's

36219
22:55:45,280 --> 22:55:49,512
no prices here it's just the unique

36220
22:55:47,160 --> 22:55:51,192
ideas of books so whereas the deregister

36221
22:55:49,512 --> 22:55:53,512
was maybe worrisome because you're

36222
22:55:51,192 --> 22:55:55,192
changing the server I think it's okay

36223
22:55:53,512 --> 22:55:57,640
because the user can only at worst buy

36224
22:55:55,192 --> 22:56:00,400
more books than then uh they might via

36225
22:55:57,640 --> 22:56:03,600
the buttons alone so how does this now

36226
22:56:00,400 --> 22:56:05,511
work well let's go into vs code again

36227
22:56:03,600 --> 22:56:08,832
here let me give myself another terminal

36228
22:56:05,512 --> 22:56:10,832
window and in Source 9/ store let me

36229
22:56:08,832 --> 22:56:12,959
open up app.py which is where all the

36230
22:56:10,832 --> 22:56:14,231
logic is so I'll flip through most of

36231
22:56:12,960 --> 22:56:16,000
this quickly because we've seen this

36232
22:56:14,232 --> 22:56:18,552
before these Imports are pretty much the

36233
22:56:16,000 --> 22:56:20,040
same as before this line is the same

36234
22:56:18,552 --> 22:56:22,760
this line is almost the same but the

36235
22:56:20,040 --> 22:56:25,599
database now is called store. DB instead

36236
22:56:22,760 --> 22:56:27,720
of frost. DB this is the boilerplate

36237
22:56:25,600 --> 22:56:29,832
code for just enabling sessions this

36238
22:56:27,720 --> 22:56:31,832
notion of a shopping cart and so let's

36239
22:56:29,832 --> 22:56:34,159
see how the index Works how is that I'm

36240
22:56:31,832 --> 22:56:37,231
seeing all seven books at once well in

36241
22:56:34,160 --> 22:56:38,872
this index function I'm using on line 19

36242
22:56:37,232 --> 22:56:40,640
select star from books to get all the

36243
22:56:38,872 --> 22:56:43,280
books from the database and then I'm

36244
22:56:40,640 --> 22:56:45,280
rendering a template called books. HTML

36245
22:56:43,280 --> 22:56:46,720
passing in as a placeholder all of those

36246
22:56:45,280 --> 22:56:48,760
books all right let's go down that

36247
22:56:46,720 --> 22:56:51,800
rabbit hole for a second let me open up

36248
22:56:48,760 --> 22:56:53,640
books. HTML in my templates directory

36249
22:56:51,800 --> 22:56:55,912
and here again even though it's you know

36250
22:56:53,640 --> 22:56:59,160
new today it's probably increasingly

36251
22:56:55,912 --> 22:57:01,800
familiar syntactically here's the H1

36252
22:56:59,160 --> 22:57:03,680
here is my Loop here's the H2 which is

36253
22:57:01,800 --> 22:57:06,440
going to Output the current book's title

36254
22:57:03,680 --> 22:57:07,832
in that Loop here's the form here's the

36255
22:57:06,440 --> 22:57:09,232
ID of that book that's going to be

36256
22:57:07,832 --> 22:57:11,912
outputed in the form so I didn't

36257
22:57:09,232 --> 22:57:14,400
manually type out seven long forms I

36258
22:57:11,912 --> 22:57:16,440
just did one in this template so that it

36259
22:57:14,400 --> 22:57:18,192
gets generated automatically literally

36260
22:57:16,440 --> 22:57:20,912
what a website CL Amazon would do to

36261
22:57:18,192 --> 22:57:23,599
show you 10 books at a time or 10 search

36262
22:57:20,912 --> 22:57:26,400
results or more at a time all right well

36263
22:57:23,600 --> 22:57:28,440
let's go to SLC cart which was the juicy

36264
22:57:26,400 --> 22:57:31,192
one and this one's longer but let's see

36265
22:57:28,440 --> 22:57:34,800
if we can reason through it if the user

36266
22:57:31,192 --> 22:57:36,871
submits via get or post to/ cart well we

36267
22:57:34,800 --> 22:57:39,040
first do this and this is just necessary

36268
22:57:36,872 --> 22:57:41,400
in some boilerplate rewrote we're going

36269
22:57:39,040 --> 22:57:43,599
to use the session object to store a

36270
22:57:41,400 --> 22:57:45,480
variable called cart that in this case

36271
22:57:43,600 --> 22:57:47,192
is going to be a list so session again

36272
22:57:45,480 --> 22:57:49,319
is just a dictionary you can put

36273
22:57:47,192 --> 22:57:53,319
anything in it you want previously we

36274
22:57:49,320 --> 22:57:55,832
put students names and sports now uh

36275
22:57:53,320 --> 22:57:59,160
what I want to do is actually sorry prev

36276
22:57:55,832 --> 22:58:01,552
previously we put uh the student name

36277
22:57:59,160 --> 22:58:05,480
the user's name in it now I'm going to

36278
22:58:01,552 --> 22:58:07,319
actually store a cart key whose value is

36279
22:58:05,480 --> 22:58:09,440
a list why because I want to aggregate

36280
22:58:07,320 --> 22:58:10,760
more and more books in this list all

36281
22:58:09,440 --> 22:58:12,960
right so that just makes sure that I

36282
22:58:10,760 --> 22:58:15,231
have at least an empty shopping cart the

36283
22:58:12,960 --> 22:58:17,480
very first time the user does this if

36284
22:58:15,232 --> 22:58:19,000
they visit this form via post let's go

36285
22:58:17,480 --> 22:58:21,680
ahead and get the ID of the book that

36286
22:58:19,000 --> 22:58:23,872
they posted if it is not empty if there

36287
22:58:21,680 --> 22:58:25,599
is a number like one or two or three

36288
22:58:23,872 --> 22:58:29,192
let's go ahead and go into the shopping

36289
22:58:25,600 --> 22:58:31,872
C cart which is a list per this line and

36290
22:58:29,192 --> 22:58:33,192
just append that ID so this list of

36291
22:58:31,872 --> 22:58:35,760
books in your shopping cart is going to

36292
22:58:33,192 --> 22:58:37,480
contain like one comma 2 comma four

36293
22:58:35,760 --> 22:58:39,799
comma six whatever books you're actually

36294
22:58:37,480 --> 22:58:42,400
buying and then the user gets redirected

36295
22:58:39,800 --> 22:58:44,552
to cart what if though the user got here

36296
22:58:42,400 --> 22:58:46,480
via get and not post well this one's

36297
22:58:44,552 --> 22:58:49,512
relatively straightforward if you just

36298
22:58:46,480 --> 22:58:53,720
visit slart we select star from books

36299
22:58:49,512 --> 22:58:56,000
where ID is in okay so this is

36300
22:58:53,720 --> 22:58:57,552
interesting this list and and this is a

36301
22:58:56,000 --> 22:58:58,912
syntax you might not have seen before

36302
22:58:57,552 --> 22:59:02,440
but if you read the documentation for

36303
22:58:58,912 --> 22:59:04,832
cs50's Library if you select something

36304
22:59:02,440 --> 22:59:07,120
and use a question mark placeholder and

36305
22:59:04,832 --> 22:59:10,552
the placeholder itself is a list we

36306
22:59:07,120 --> 22:59:12,480
output a comma separated list of values

36307
22:59:10,552 --> 22:59:15,400
just like you would use maybe in problem

36308
22:59:12,480 --> 22:59:17,832
Set uh seven for doing SQL queries on

36309
22:59:15,400 --> 22:59:20,000
your own so this just means show me only

36310
22:59:17,832 --> 22:59:21,552
those books in my shopping cart not

36311
22:59:20,000 --> 22:59:24,080
Carters not someone else's not in the

36312
22:59:21,552 --> 22:59:26,319
whole database only show me the books in

36313
22:59:24,080 --> 22:59:28,912
my shopping cart and then

36314
22:59:26,320 --> 22:59:31,872
render it as such so we only saw what

36315
22:59:28,912 --> 22:59:34,440
the catalog here looks like at slash

36316
22:59:31,872 --> 22:59:36,192
books Let's go ahead and in slash let's

36317
22:59:34,440 --> 22:59:40,680
go ahead and add maybe the first book to

36318
22:59:36,192 --> 22:59:43,159
my cart and now I see at SLC cart only

36319
22:59:40,680 --> 22:59:45,359
that first book whose ID is one let me

36320
22:59:43,160 --> 22:59:47,192
now go back to the bookstore here scroll

36321
22:59:45,360 --> 22:59:50,400
down to maybe the seventh book and add

36322
22:59:47,192 --> 22:59:52,871
that to my cart and now I see this here

36323
22:59:50,400 --> 22:59:56,319
too meanwhile all of this information is

36324
22:59:52,872 --> 22:59:58,320
stored in my session and so when I

36325
22:59:56,320 --> 23:00:01,640
reload this cart again and again the

36326
22:59:58,320 --> 23:00:03,640
reason I'm only seeing my two is because

36327
23:00:01,640 --> 23:00:05,960
we're checking only the list in my

36328
23:00:03,640 --> 23:00:07,280
session and flasks make sure again that

36329
23:00:05,960 --> 23:00:08,600
my session is different from your

36330
23:00:07,280 --> 23:00:11,040
session is different from Carter's

36331
23:00:08,600 --> 23:00:13,440
session as well but you write the code

36332
23:00:11,040 --> 23:00:15,912
once and it works for thousands millions

36333
23:00:13,440 --> 23:00:20,480
of people in

36334
23:00:15,912 --> 23:00:23,080
parallel any questions on

36335
23:00:20,480 --> 23:00:27,552
this this yes in the

36336
23:00:23,080 --> 23:00:27,552
back sorry say a little louder

36337
23:00:29,760 --> 23:00:35,231
uh so to recap so users will never have

36338
23:00:33,400 --> 23:00:36,832
the same session values theoretically

36339
23:00:35,232 --> 23:00:38,360
the cookie that gets planted does not

36340
23:00:36,832 --> 23:00:40,799
look like a smiley face for everyone

36341
23:00:38,360 --> 23:00:42,160
each of us gets a big random number

36342
23:00:40,800 --> 23:00:44,120
that's assigned to us so it' be like

36343
23:00:42,160 --> 23:00:45,832
each of us gets a completely unique hand

36344
23:00:44,120 --> 23:00:47,512
stamp that no one else can see the

36345
23:00:45,832 --> 23:00:50,231
reason no one else can see it is because

36346
23:00:47,512 --> 23:00:51,832
if the website's using https every time

36347
23:00:50,232 --> 23:00:53,600
this hand stamp is shown every time this

36348
23:00:51,832 --> 23:00:56,552
cookie is sent back and forth It's all

36349
23:00:53,600 --> 23:00:58,360
encrypted as well so each of us can even

36350
23:00:56,552 --> 23:00:59,832
if we have the same contents by

36351
23:00:58,360 --> 23:01:01,960
coincidence because we like the same

36352
23:00:59,832 --> 23:01:04,912
books they will be separate cookies

36353
23:01:01,960 --> 23:01:07,280
separate memory separate sessions behind

36354
23:01:04,912 --> 23:01:07,280
you

36355
23:01:08,480 --> 23:01:12,552
yeah really good question when does the

36356
23:01:10,600 --> 23:01:14,640
session end totally configurable

36357
23:01:12,552 --> 23:01:16,912
typically it ends when you close the tab

36358
23:01:14,640 --> 23:01:19,000
or when you quit the browser or you can

36359
23:01:16,912 --> 23:01:21,080
also configure cookies to themselves be

36360
23:01:19,000 --> 23:01:24,800
persistent for a day for a week for

36361
23:01:21,080 --> 23:01:27,800
longer so for instance when you log into

36362
23:01:24,800 --> 23:01:29,600
um uh say Gmail they plant a cookie on

36363
23:01:27,800 --> 23:01:31,120
your computer probably for a week a

36364
23:01:29,600 --> 23:01:32,720
month a year something like that because

36365
23:01:31,120 --> 23:01:34,720
it would be annoying and probably drive

36366
23:01:32,720 --> 23:01:36,872
you to like Outlook or something else if

36367
23:01:34,720 --> 23:01:38,552
you kept having to log into your account

36368
23:01:36,872 --> 23:01:40,192
whereas your bank account might actually

36369
23:01:38,552 --> 23:01:42,120
wait for you to just close the tab and

36370
23:01:40,192 --> 23:01:43,680
then for your own Financial safety they

36371
23:01:42,120 --> 23:01:45,912
just automatically delete the session

36372
23:01:43,680 --> 23:01:47,359
far sooner but totally configurable by

36373
23:01:45,912 --> 23:01:48,680
default as I'm using it it will

36374
23:01:47,360 --> 23:01:50,720
typically be thrown away when the

36375
23:01:48,680 --> 23:01:53,400
browser itself quits and here too is

36376
23:01:50,720 --> 23:01:55,000
another reason to develop websites using

36377
23:01:53,400 --> 23:01:56,360
incognito mode because if you want to

36378
23:01:55,000 --> 23:01:58,480
just throw throw away all of your

36379
23:01:56,360 --> 23:01:59,960
cookies you close the incognito window

36380
23:01:58,480 --> 23:02:01,720
mode open a new one and now you're

36381
23:01:59,960 --> 23:02:03,872
starting from scratch you don't have to

36382
23:02:01,720 --> 23:02:05,640
manually delete all your cookies which

36383
23:02:03,872 --> 23:02:09,320
could log you out of websites you

36384
23:02:05,640 --> 23:02:09,319
actually care about

36385
23:02:10,552 --> 23:02:14,832
yeah a good question when using sessions

36386
23:02:13,040 --> 23:02:16,439
if someone maliciously changes the value

36387
23:02:14,832 --> 23:02:19,000
of sub forms could it affect other

36388
23:02:16,440 --> 23:02:20,760
people theoretically no because the

36389
23:02:19,000 --> 23:02:22,400
worst you can do is like add books to

36390
23:02:20,760 --> 23:02:23,912
your own shopping cart that you don't

36391
23:02:22,400 --> 23:02:25,799
want there so at that point even though

36392
23:02:23,912 --> 23:02:29,720
it's on the server it doesn't affect you

36393
23:02:25,800 --> 23:02:32,640
or Carter or anyone else unless there is

36394
23:02:29,720 --> 23:02:34,912
something more globally happening like

36395
23:02:32,640 --> 23:02:36,600
registering or deregistering for a sport

36396
23:02:34,912 --> 23:02:38,480
or removing books from the Amazon

36397
23:02:36,600 --> 23:02:40,600
database that would be problematic but

36398
23:02:38,480 --> 23:02:43,512
in this case we're removing things only

36399
23:02:40,600 --> 23:02:46,280
from my own session that the website is

36400
23:02:43,512 --> 23:02:48,480
giving me all right the last topic for

36401
23:02:46,280 --> 23:02:50,280
today is this thing here which is sort

36402
23:02:48,480 --> 23:02:52,872
of everywhere nowadays these things

36403
23:02:50,280 --> 23:02:54,640
called apis or application programming

36404
23:02:52,872 --> 23:02:56,760
interfaces and this is a very generic

36405
23:02:54,640 --> 23:03:00,720
term in fact because any function you've

36406
23:02:56,760 --> 23:03:03,480
used in C in scratch in Python in SQL

36407
23:03:00,720 --> 23:03:06,440
are all apis like there is a standard

36408
23:03:03,480 --> 23:03:08,319
way of interfacing with those functions

36409
23:03:06,440 --> 23:03:09,832
they all have names they sometimes have

36410
23:03:08,320 --> 23:03:12,832
return values they sometimes have

36411
23:03:09,832 --> 23:03:16,159
arguments and an API is just how you use

36412
23:03:12,832 --> 23:03:18,159
a function or more generally an API just

36413
23:03:16,160 --> 23:03:20,480
specifies how you interact with some

36414
23:03:18,160 --> 23:03:23,000
service and so nowadays there's a lot of

36415
23:03:20,480 --> 23:03:24,912
web-based services that you can use to

36416
23:03:23,000 --> 23:03:27,720
get back data like the weather or the

36417
23:03:24,912 --> 23:03:30,400
current time or the database of Amazon

36418
23:03:27,720 --> 23:03:32,640
books for instance all might have apis

36419
23:03:30,400 --> 23:03:34,871
often web-based that allow you using

36420
23:03:32,640 --> 23:03:36,680
URLs or some other technology to just

36421
23:03:34,872 --> 23:03:38,912
get data from someone else as though

36422
23:03:36,680 --> 23:03:41,400
it's a function you're calling remotely

36423
23:03:38,912 --> 23:03:43,640
but HTTP is very often the mechanism

36424
23:03:41,400 --> 23:03:45,799
that's used to actually get data from

36425
23:03:43,640 --> 23:03:48,000
servers and the way the data can come

36426
23:03:45,800 --> 23:03:50,080
back can be as follows let me end with

36427
23:03:48,000 --> 23:03:53,680
one final example using some of our

36428
23:03:50,080 --> 23:03:55,280
familiar shows from uh weeks past let me

36429
23:03:53,680 --> 23:03:58,159
go ahead and close the old flask version

36430
23:03:55,280 --> 23:04:02,800
version go back into Source 9 and go

36431
23:03:58,160 --> 23:04:04,720
into how about an example called shows

36432
23:04:02,800 --> 23:04:06,080
and the first version of this zero I'm

36433
23:04:04,720 --> 23:04:08,600
just going to go ahead and run with

36434
23:04:06,080 --> 23:04:11,280
flask run I'll hover over my URL and

36435
23:04:08,600 --> 23:04:13,080
open it here and you'll see now that I

36436
23:04:11,280 --> 23:04:15,872
have a very simple form as we keep doing

36437
23:04:13,080 --> 23:04:18,480
today I'm going to type in like o f f i

36438
23:04:15,872 --> 23:04:21,552
c office into this search box and click

36439
23:04:18,480 --> 23:04:24,872
search and you'll see now that I ended

36440
23:04:21,552 --> 23:04:27,000
up at a URL ending in/ search question

36441
23:04:24,872 --> 23:04:29,400
mark Q equals office so this is like my

36442
23:04:27,000 --> 23:04:32,440
own baby version of google.com but I

36443
23:04:29,400 --> 23:04:34,680
implemented it myself and for any title

36444
23:04:32,440 --> 23:04:38,832
of a TV show from a couple of weeks past

36445
23:04:34,680 --> 23:04:41,439
that matches o i I spit it out into an

36446
23:04:38,832 --> 23:04:42,912
unordered list how is this working you

36447
23:04:41,440 --> 23:04:44,640
can maybe imagine even if you might not

36448
23:04:42,912 --> 23:04:46,912
be able to program this off the top of

36449
23:04:44,640 --> 23:04:50,192
your head certainly so soon let me go

36450
23:04:46,912 --> 23:04:52,599
into Source 9 let me go into uh show

36451
23:04:50,192 --> 23:04:55,231
zero let me open up

36452
23:04:52,600 --> 23:04:57,280
app.py and in this file you'll see that

36453
23:04:55,232 --> 23:04:59,480
that I'm grabbing a uh file called

36454
23:04:57,280 --> 23:05:00,720
shows. DB which is like a simpler

36455
23:04:59,480 --> 23:05:03,440
version of the one from a couple of

36456
23:05:00,720 --> 23:05:05,680
weeks past uh here is why I see the web

36457
23:05:03,440 --> 23:05:07,760
form my first route my index is super

36458
23:05:05,680 --> 23:05:09,480
simple it just spits out that form and

36459
23:05:07,760 --> 23:05:11,871
my search route like you can think of

36460
23:05:09,480 --> 23:05:14,512
this as google.com there only like four

36461
23:05:11,872 --> 23:05:17,232
lines of code so if the user sends data

36462
23:05:14,512 --> 23:05:19,400
to SL search this function called search

36463
23:05:17,232 --> 23:05:22,360
is called I declare a variable called

36464
23:05:19,400 --> 23:05:25,760
shows I execute a SQL command that is

36465
23:05:22,360 --> 23:05:27,720
Select star from shows where title like

36466
23:05:25,760 --> 23:05:30,720
question mark and the syntax here is a

36467
23:05:27,720 --> 23:05:34,040
little crazy but I want to prefix to the

36468
23:05:30,720 --> 23:05:36,320
user's input percent sign and suffix it

36469
23:05:34,040 --> 23:05:38,599
with a percent sign as well putting in

36470
23:05:36,320 --> 23:05:41,600
the between those two values the actual

36471
23:05:38,600 --> 23:05:43,040
input why in SQL what is it mean if you

36472
23:05:41,600 --> 23:05:45,480
have a percent sign to the left and to

36473
23:05:43,040 --> 23:05:48,120
the right nothing to do with Ginger

36474
23:05:45,480 --> 23:05:50,192
today yeah it's a it's a wild card so it

36475
23:05:48,120 --> 23:05:52,159
means match zero or more characters on

36476
23:05:50,192 --> 23:05:54,360
the left or match zero or more

36477
23:05:52,160 --> 23:05:55,872
characters on the right you have to do

36478
23:05:54,360 --> 23:05:57,680
the concatenation

36479
23:05:55,872 --> 23:05:59,120
as the second argument to this function

36480
23:05:57,680 --> 23:06:02,280
you can't do something clever like put

36481
23:05:59,120 --> 23:06:03,832
it here around the like the is the

36482
23:06:02,280 --> 23:06:06,552
placeholder that you plug these values

36483
23:06:03,832 --> 23:06:08,959
into but this just means hey SQL show me

36484
23:06:06,552 --> 23:06:11,400
all of the titles that have o f i

36485
23:06:08,960 --> 23:06:14,600
somewhere in them that gives me back an

36486
23:06:11,400 --> 23:06:16,599
a list of dictionaries I pass that in as

36487
23:06:14,600 --> 23:06:19,280
a placeholder for a variable called

36488
23:06:16,600 --> 23:06:20,480
shows and if we look at search. HTML

36489
23:06:19,280 --> 23:06:21,480
let's look at that in my templates

36490
23:06:20,480 --> 23:06:24,440
directory there's something called

36491
23:06:21,480 --> 23:06:26,599
search. HTML super simple I mean this is

36492
23:06:24,440 --> 23:06:29,040
like the essence of google.com search

36493
23:06:26,600 --> 23:06:31,040
results I'm using an unordered list to

36494
23:06:29,040 --> 23:06:33,040
keep things simple but I iterate over

36495
23:06:31,040 --> 23:06:35,319
every show in the shows list that came

36496
23:06:33,040 --> 23:06:36,799
back and I output An Li with each of

36497
23:06:35,320 --> 23:06:38,360
those shows titles and that's it now

36498
23:06:36,800 --> 23:06:40,080
Google has like Blue Links and like

36499
23:06:38,360 --> 23:06:42,120
little previews and other text the first

36500
23:06:40,080 --> 23:06:43,912
sentence or so from each page but like

36501
23:06:42,120 --> 23:06:46,120
that's the idea like this is really

36502
23:06:43,912 --> 23:06:49,640
similar in spirit to what google.com

36503
23:06:46,120 --> 23:06:52,000
search does for you now how is this

36504
23:06:49,640 --> 23:06:54,872
working there's no API involved here yet

36505
23:06:52,000 --> 23:06:56,640
this is just very basic HTTP I submit

36506
23:06:54,872 --> 23:06:58,680
the the form I go to another route and I

36507
23:06:56,640 --> 23:07:01,319
get back the results but check out this

36508
23:06:58,680 --> 23:07:03,959
version Let me close these tabs here and

36509
23:07:01,320 --> 23:07:06,912
open my first terminal window let me go

36510
23:07:03,960 --> 23:07:09,552
into shows one from today's Source 9

36511
23:07:06,912 --> 23:07:11,480
directory and do flask run this time let

36512
23:07:09,552 --> 23:07:13,800
me go ahead and hover over that URL and

36513
23:07:11,480 --> 23:07:16,000
open it here and gone now is the submit

36514
23:07:13,800 --> 23:07:18,232
button now I'm going to make an user

36515
23:07:16,000 --> 23:07:21,280
interface that uses a technique called

36516
23:07:18,232 --> 23:07:23,600
Ajax for asynchronous uh JavaScript and

36517
23:07:21,280 --> 23:07:25,080
XML which is somewhat of a data term

36518
23:07:23,600 --> 23:07:27,960
because we're not using something called

36519
23:07:25,080 --> 23:07:30,400
ml anymore but Ajax is a technique

36520
23:07:27,960 --> 23:07:32,600
whereby you don't have to submit forms

36521
23:07:30,400 --> 23:07:35,439
anymore to get more data from the server

36522
23:07:32,600 --> 23:07:37,512
you can use JavaScript per last week

36523
23:07:35,440 --> 23:07:39,872
listen for an event like the key press

36524
23:07:37,512 --> 23:07:42,120
coming down or up and as soon as you

36525
23:07:39,872 --> 23:07:43,960
hear such an event you can secretly in

36526
23:07:42,120 --> 23:07:46,440
JavaScript code send a request to the

36527
23:07:43,960 --> 23:07:49,280
server to get back more data and then

36528
23:07:46,440 --> 23:07:51,080
plug it into the Dom the tree in the

36529
23:07:49,280 --> 23:07:52,832
computer's memory and this just makes

36530
23:07:51,080 --> 23:07:55,192
for more seamless experiences like

36531
23:07:52,832 --> 23:07:57,760
autocomplete on any website so now let

36532
23:07:55,192 --> 23:08:02,552
me try typing o okay we got auto

36533
23:07:57,760 --> 23:08:05,439
complete super fast f f i c e and you'll

36534
23:08:02,552 --> 23:08:07,440
see every time I add more keys to my

36535
23:08:05,440 --> 23:08:09,440
input I'm doing another search another

36536
23:08:07,440 --> 23:08:11,440
search another search and the data is

36537
23:08:09,440 --> 23:08:13,232
changing now how is this working well

36538
23:08:11,440 --> 23:08:16,600
let me go back to vs code here and in my

36539
23:08:13,232 --> 23:08:20,040
other terminal window let me open up uh

36540
23:08:16,600 --> 23:08:21,512
app.py and in app.py you'll see that

36541
23:08:20,040 --> 23:08:25,439
there's still a

36542
23:08:21,512 --> 23:08:28,440
search route down below that turns a

36543
23:08:25,440 --> 23:08:33,000
search template but watch this let me go

36544
23:08:28,440 --> 23:08:36,400
into templates search. HTML and notice

36545
23:08:33,000 --> 23:08:40,440
here that we're indeed getting back an

36546
23:08:36,400 --> 23:08:44,720
unordered list of shows again and again

36547
23:08:40,440 --> 23:08:48,192
and again and this HTML that's coming

36548
23:08:44,720 --> 23:08:50,120
back let me go here let me open my

36549
23:08:48,192 --> 23:08:52,231
terminal oh sorry this is the wrong

36550
23:08:50,120 --> 23:08:55,640
version uh sorry I was in the wrong

36551
23:08:52,232 --> 23:08:58,232
folder let's fix this and shows one code

36552
23:08:55,640 --> 23:08:59,872
of app.py it's almost the same thing

36553
23:08:58,232 --> 23:09:02,440
inserch

36554
23:08:59,872 --> 23:09:03,872
here okay well I changed this slightly

36555
23:09:02,440 --> 23:09:06,360
let me show you this version of search

36556
23:09:03,872 --> 23:09:09,120
if I open up app.py here's my search

36557
23:09:06,360 --> 23:09:11,040
route I'm getting a variable called Q

36558
23:09:09,120 --> 23:09:13,400
giving it the value of whatever request.

36559
23:09:11,040 --> 23:09:15,439
RX has from the user like Q equals

36560
23:09:13,400 --> 23:09:17,319
office and then I'm checking if the user

36561
23:09:15,440 --> 23:09:19,440
actually typed something in execute this

36562
23:09:17,320 --> 23:09:21,552
SQL query select star from shows where

36563
23:09:19,440 --> 23:09:23,280
title is like that using the same and

36564
23:09:21,552 --> 23:09:25,360
this time just to keep things efficient

36565
23:09:23,280 --> 23:09:27,640
I limited the total results to 50

36566
23:09:25,360 --> 23:09:29,912
instead of an infinite number otherwise

36567
23:09:27,640 --> 23:09:32,120
if the user type nothing just to be

36568
23:09:29,912 --> 23:09:33,832
super safe here I'm setting shows equal

36569
23:09:32,120 --> 23:09:35,599
to an empty list so if you don't type

36570
23:09:33,832 --> 23:09:37,599
anything there's nothing to show and no

36571
23:09:35,600 --> 23:09:40,192
matter what I render this template

36572
23:09:37,600 --> 23:09:43,600
called search. HTML well let's look at

36573
23:09:40,192 --> 23:09:46,512
that if I open up templat search. HTML

36574
23:09:43,600 --> 23:09:49,160
this time there's no layout there's no

36575
23:09:46,512 --> 23:09:51,400
inheritance of that layout. HTML I am

36576
23:09:49,160 --> 23:09:54,760
literally generating just a whole bunch

36577
23:09:51,400 --> 23:09:55,959
of Li fragments why well let's see what

36578
23:09:54,760 --> 23:09:58,552
what's happening in the browser and this

36579
23:09:55,960 --> 23:10:00,640
is the beginning of an API if I wanted

36580
23:09:58,552 --> 23:10:02,360
to make this API available this

36581
23:10:00,640 --> 23:10:03,912
application programming interface I

36582
23:10:02,360 --> 23:10:07,192
could tell the world that if you want to

36583
23:10:03,912 --> 23:10:10,872
search for TV shows in my database go to

36584
23:10:07,192 --> 23:10:15,159
URL that's something something/ search

36585
23:10:10,872 --> 23:10:17,232
question mark Q equals office or cat or

36586
23:10:15,160 --> 23:10:20,120
dog or anything else and what I will

36587
23:10:17,232 --> 23:10:22,120
return to you is this enter I will just

36588
23:10:20,120 --> 23:10:23,640
give you a whole bunch of Li tags which

36589
23:10:22,120 --> 23:10:26,480
almost looks the same but let me view

36590
23:10:23,640 --> 23:10:28,640
the page source only am I going to hand

36591
23:10:26,480 --> 23:10:30,640
you back a fragment of HTML I'm not

36592
23:10:28,640 --> 23:10:32,120
giving you an HTML tag a body tag a

36593
23:10:30,640 --> 23:10:34,760
title tag a head tag I'm not giving you

36594
23:10:32,120 --> 23:10:36,720
a web page I'm giving you a fragment of

36595
23:10:34,760 --> 23:10:40,231
HTML that you can now do whatever you

36596
23:10:36,720 --> 23:10:43,720
want including insert this into your own

36597
23:10:40,232 --> 23:10:46,080
unordered list so notice what happens in

36598
23:10:43,720 --> 23:10:49,192
this actual app if I go back to vs code

36599
23:10:46,080 --> 23:10:51,912
here let me open up my index template

36600
23:10:49,192 --> 23:10:55,760
here and you'll see some JavaScript

36601
23:10:51,912 --> 23:10:58,120
magic so in JavaScript here in my form

36602
23:10:55,760 --> 23:11:01,680
that only had the text box and no button

36603
23:10:58,120 --> 23:11:03,720
what am I doing in a script tag here I

36604
23:11:01,680 --> 23:11:05,511
am creating a variable called input and

36605
23:11:03,720 --> 23:11:08,760
I'm using this function called query

36606
23:11:05,512 --> 23:11:11,552
selector that just gets me a reference

36607
23:11:08,760 --> 23:11:13,599
to the input text box on the form so I

36608
23:11:11,552 --> 23:11:15,552
can see what the human typed this is a

36609
23:11:13,600 --> 23:11:18,640
little different today but I'm using

36610
23:11:15,552 --> 23:11:20,552
input. atevent listener which is a way

36611
23:11:18,640 --> 23:11:23,040
in JavaScript to tell it just like in

36612
23:11:20,552 --> 23:11:24,800
scratch listen for something to happen

36613
23:11:23,040 --> 23:11:27,000
like the green flag being clicked but in

36614
23:11:24,800 --> 23:11:29,872
this case listen for an event that

36615
23:11:27,000 --> 23:11:31,552
involves input that is like typing on

36616
23:11:29,872 --> 23:11:35,160
the keyboard whether it's by a copy

36617
23:11:31,552 --> 23:11:37,192
paste manual input or anything else then

36618
23:11:35,160 --> 23:11:39,120
whenever that happens call this function

36619
23:11:37,192 --> 23:11:41,832
and async stands for asynchronous this

36620
23:11:39,120 --> 23:11:43,360
is a term of art which means that this

36621
23:11:41,832 --> 23:11:44,871
this function might take like a split

36622
23:11:43,360 --> 23:11:47,000
second maybe even a second or two to

36623
23:11:44,872 --> 23:11:48,912
execute so it's going to do it behind

36624
23:11:47,000 --> 23:11:51,760
the scenes like in the background so to

36625
23:11:48,912 --> 23:11:53,512
speak and what is it going to do well

36626
23:11:51,760 --> 23:11:55,192
it's going to call a JavaScript function

36627
23:11:53,512 --> 23:11:58,232
that all browsers now Support called

36628
23:11:55,192 --> 23:12:00,231
Fetch which is a function that uses HTTP

36629
23:11:58,232 --> 23:12:02,192
to go fetch more data via the from the

36630
23:12:00,232 --> 23:12:05,320
server it's going to fetch data from a

36631
23:12:02,192 --> 23:12:07,280
route called SL search question mark Q

36632
23:12:05,320 --> 23:12:09,280
equals and whatever the value is that

36633
23:12:07,280 --> 23:12:11,552
the user typed in so I'm just sort of

36634
23:12:09,280 --> 23:12:14,232
manually creating my own mini URL and

36635
23:12:11,552 --> 23:12:17,280
telling JavaScript go fetch me that HTML

36636
23:12:14,232 --> 23:12:19,192
when it comes back via this line of text

36637
23:12:17,280 --> 23:12:21,280
here called response. text and let me

36638
23:12:19,192 --> 23:12:22,640
wave my hand at await await just means

36639
23:12:21,280 --> 23:12:24,120
this might not come back immediately

36640
23:12:22,640 --> 23:12:25,760
let's await the response and when it

36641
23:12:24,120 --> 23:12:28,000
does come and then let's execute this

36642
23:12:25,760 --> 23:12:30,192
code I'm going to do this I'm going to

36643
23:12:28,000 --> 23:12:33,280
search the document the whole web page

36644
23:12:30,192 --> 23:12:35,040
for this UL tag which is somewhere in

36645
23:12:33,280 --> 23:12:37,760
this page that we'll see in a moment

36646
23:12:35,040 --> 23:12:40,599
change its inner HTML to be that

36647
23:12:37,760 --> 23:12:42,640
fragment of Li Li Li of all of those

36648
23:12:40,600 --> 23:12:44,552
matching shows and where does this all

36649
23:12:42,640 --> 23:12:47,280
go well if we scroll up here you'll

36650
23:12:44,552 --> 23:12:50,319
notice that there's my usual HTML up at

36651
23:12:47,280 --> 23:12:52,080
top head tag body tag and all of that

36652
23:12:50,320 --> 23:12:54,480
there's the text box that we've talked

36653
23:12:52,080 --> 23:12:55,912
about already there's no button for

36654
23:12:54,480 --> 23:12:58,040
submitting cuz it all happens

36655
23:12:55,912 --> 23:13:00,080
automatically but there is by default

36656
23:12:58,040 --> 23:13:03,719
this empty UL that has nothing by

36657
23:13:00,080 --> 23:13:06,512
default until we start using that API

36658
23:13:03,720 --> 23:13:10,552
and the final flourish here is this this

36659
23:13:06,512 --> 23:13:12,280
is kind of a uh ugly sloppy way to get

36660
23:13:10,552 --> 23:13:14,512
data from a server to just get back like

36661
23:13:12,280 --> 23:13:17,120
a fragment of HTML like what if I'm not

36662
23:13:14,512 --> 23:13:19,680
using HTML I want to store these uh TV

36663
23:13:17,120 --> 23:13:21,720
shows in a PDF or in some other wet tag

36664
23:13:19,680 --> 23:13:23,231
in a table or something like that it

36665
23:13:21,720 --> 23:13:25,640
doesn't really make sense for the server

36666
23:13:23,232 --> 23:13:28,120
to be presuming that I want Li tags

36667
23:13:25,640 --> 23:13:30,720
surrounding each of my data better would

36668
23:13:28,120 --> 23:13:32,959
be to get a more generic format back and

36669
23:13:30,720 --> 23:13:36,160
that format is almost always nowadays

36670
23:13:32,960 --> 23:13:38,960
called this our final acronym Json

36671
23:13:36,160 --> 23:13:41,640
JavaScript object notation and let me do

36672
23:13:38,960 --> 23:13:45,440
this let me close these two tabs here

36673
23:13:41,640 --> 23:13:47,600
and open my terminal window and C cancel

36674
23:13:45,440 --> 23:13:49,720
the previous version of flask that was

36675
23:13:47,600 --> 23:13:51,552
running let me close this version and

36676
23:13:49,720 --> 23:13:54,552
look at our final version called shows

36677
23:13:51,552 --> 23:13:56,552
two and do flask run on I'm going to

36678
23:13:54,552 --> 23:13:59,159
hover over that URL and open it in a

36679
23:13:56,552 --> 23:14:03,231
browser and I'm going to manually visit

36680
23:13:59,160 --> 23:14:07,040
after zooming in let's do again slash uh

36681
23:14:03,232 --> 23:14:10,400
search question mark uh Q equals Office

36682
23:14:07,040 --> 23:14:11,912
enter and this is what Json looks like

36683
23:14:10,400 --> 23:14:13,680
now at a glance this does not seem like

36684
23:14:11,912 --> 23:14:15,720
an improvement like this looks crazy

36685
23:14:13,680 --> 23:14:17,511
that it's just this Big Blob of text but

36686
23:14:15,720 --> 23:14:20,440
it's just enough text for the computer

36687
23:14:17,512 --> 23:14:22,960
to be able to process it reliably notice

36688
23:14:20,440 --> 23:14:24,360
that there's a cur a square bracket here

36689
23:14:22,960 --> 23:14:25,832
and if I actually scroll to the Bott

36690
23:14:24,360 --> 23:14:27,872
botom there' be a closed square bracket

36691
23:14:25,832 --> 23:14:31,192
like way down there inside of that

36692
23:14:27,872 --> 23:14:33,872
square bracket is a curly brace then ID

36693
23:14:31,192 --> 23:14:36,480
colon and then a number then a title

36694
23:14:33,872 --> 23:14:38,720
quote unquote colon and then the title

36695
23:14:36,480 --> 23:14:40,400
and then the closed curly brace so what

36696
23:14:38,720 --> 23:14:42,232
you're seeing in JavaScript object

36697
23:14:40,400 --> 23:14:44,480
notation is a very standard super

36698
23:14:42,232 --> 23:14:46,800
popular format that's just text that

36699
23:14:44,480 --> 23:14:49,192
still uses square brackets for lists AKA

36700
23:14:46,800 --> 23:14:51,720
arrays that still uses curly braces for

36701
23:14:49,192 --> 23:14:54,120
dictionaries key value pairs so what you

36702
23:14:51,720 --> 23:14:56,120
see here is a massive list up to 50 I

36703
23:14:54,120 --> 23:14:59,912
think think shows that came back from

36704
23:14:56,120 --> 23:15:02,599
this API Each of which has a dictionary

36705
23:14:59,912 --> 23:15:05,280
if you will an object of key value pairs

36706
23:15:02,600 --> 23:15:07,680
what keys and values an ID key and a

36707
23:15:05,280 --> 23:15:09,512
title key Each of which has a value

36708
23:15:07,680 --> 23:15:11,799
respectively and this is the same data

36709
23:15:09,512 --> 23:15:14,280
from IMDb some of which you might be

36710
23:15:11,800 --> 23:15:16,832
recalling visually this is just a very

36711
23:15:14,280 --> 23:15:18,232
raw computer friendly way of returning a

36712
23:15:16,832 --> 23:15:21,720
whole bunch of data that we humans don't

36713
23:15:18,232 --> 23:15:23,872
need to see but I can use this data by

36714
23:15:21,720 --> 23:15:25,552
going back into vs code let me open

36715
23:15:23,872 --> 23:15:26,640
another terminal window and go into

36716
23:15:25,552 --> 23:15:31,040
Source

36717
23:15:26,640 --> 23:15:35,600
9/ shows 2 and in here let me go ahead

36718
23:15:31,040 --> 23:15:38,959
and open up how about uh templates

36719
23:15:35,600 --> 23:15:41,600
index.html which previously just used

36720
23:15:38,960 --> 23:15:43,000
that inner HTML trick and this is not

36721
23:15:41,600 --> 23:15:45,360
going to impress you're not going to be

36722
23:15:43,000 --> 23:15:47,480
pleased with this syntax but let me just

36723
23:15:45,360 --> 23:15:49,912
at least explain what we're doing it

36724
23:15:47,480 --> 23:15:51,760
turns out that Json is just the better

36725
23:15:49,912 --> 23:15:54,280
way in general the more generic

36726
23:15:51,760 --> 23:15:55,959
multi-purpose user agnostic language

36727
23:15:54,280 --> 23:15:57,680
agnostic way of returning data from a

36728
23:15:55,960 --> 23:15:58,912
server because it's just text so it

36729
23:15:57,680 --> 23:16:01,912
doesn't matter if you're using python or

36730
23:15:58,912 --> 23:16:03,120
C or C++ or JavaScript or Ruby or PHP or

36731
23:16:01,912 --> 23:16:06,360
something else like all of those

36732
23:16:03,120 --> 23:16:08,159
languages can process Json information

36733
23:16:06,360 --> 23:16:10,360
and indeed here is some JavaScript that

36734
23:16:08,160 --> 23:16:12,480
does just that same code as before

36735
23:16:10,360 --> 23:16:14,232
initially I declare a variable called

36736
23:16:12,480 --> 23:16:17,360
input that gives me access to the user's

36737
23:16:14,232 --> 23:16:19,512
text box I listen for input like key

36738
23:16:17,360 --> 23:16:22,760
strokes going up and down and when they

36739
23:16:19,512 --> 23:16:24,720
happen I call this Anonymous function uh

36740
23:16:22,760 --> 23:16:27,159
I fetch data from the server using the

36741
23:16:24,720 --> 23:16:29,440
exact same code as before search

36742
23:16:27,160 --> 23:16:32,440
question mark Q equals office or

36743
23:16:29,440 --> 23:16:35,680
anything else and then this is just now

36744
23:16:32,440 --> 23:16:38,832
new code that I use to convert that Json

36745
23:16:35,680 --> 23:16:41,480
data into my own HTML format be it an

36746
23:16:38,832 --> 23:16:43,720
unordered list an ordered list a table

36747
23:16:41,480 --> 23:16:45,552
or anything else what am I doing I've

36748
23:16:43,720 --> 23:16:48,480
got a variable called HTML initialized

36749
23:16:45,552 --> 23:16:51,440
to nothing so I've got no HTML initially

36750
23:16:48,480 --> 23:16:53,599
I then iterate over every ID in those

36751
23:16:51,440 --> 23:16:55,680
shows so every one of IMDB's unique

36752
23:16:53,600 --> 23:16:59,232
identifiers I iterate over them one at a

36753
23:16:55,680 --> 23:17:03,000
time and then I go into the show at its

36754
23:16:59,232 --> 23:17:05,192
ID location and I grab its title and

36755
23:17:03,000 --> 23:17:08,232
this

36756
23:17:05,192 --> 23:17:11,599
is forget this for just a moment I then

36757
23:17:08,232 --> 23:17:15,480
take this HTML variable concatenate or

36758
23:17:11,600 --> 23:17:18,480
join onto it my own Li tag plus the

36759
23:17:15,480 --> 23:17:20,000
title plus the close Li tag and I

36760
23:17:18,480 --> 23:17:22,000
skipped this because it got scary pretty

36761
23:17:20,000 --> 23:17:24,552
fast but it turns out that if some TV

36762
23:17:22,000 --> 23:17:27,552
shows have actually angled brackets in

36763
23:17:24,552 --> 23:17:29,480
that could break my HTML entirely so it

36764
23:17:27,552 --> 23:17:31,640
turns out you might recall super briefly

36765
23:17:29,480 --> 23:17:34,159
last week we had the copyright symbol

36766
23:17:31,640 --> 23:17:37,160
using an HTML entity using the Ampersand

36767
23:17:34,160 --> 23:17:39,480
and the hash symbol and 169 semicolon it

36768
23:17:37,160 --> 23:17:41,912
turns out there are other such cryptic

36769
23:17:39,480 --> 23:17:44,040
sequences of characters that represent

36770
23:17:41,912 --> 23:17:46,400
otherwise dangerous or untypable

36771
23:17:44,040 --> 23:17:47,719
characters like this which could confuse

36772
23:17:46,400 --> 23:17:49,799
the computer into thinking it's at the

36773
23:17:47,720 --> 23:17:51,320
beginning of a tag and an Amper sand

36774
23:17:49,800 --> 23:17:53,640
which could similarly trick the computer

36775
23:17:51,320 --> 23:17:55,912
into thinking that it's a entity which

36776
23:17:53,640 --> 23:17:57,720
it isn't but long story short there are

36777
23:17:55,912 --> 23:17:59,599
libraries thankfully that handle much of

36778
23:17:57,720 --> 23:18:01,232
this for you for our purposes the

36779
23:17:59,600 --> 23:18:02,160
takeaway is that now that you understand

36780
23:18:01,232 --> 23:18:04,280
a bit of

36781
23:18:02,160 --> 23:18:06,720
HTTP uh now that you understand a bit of

36782
23:18:04,280 --> 23:18:08,760
HTML CSS and JavaScript all of which

36783
23:18:06,720 --> 23:18:10,512
they have their roles you can use them

36784
23:18:08,760 --> 23:18:12,720
ultimately to start assembling your own

36785
23:18:10,512 --> 23:18:14,960
web applications as you will for problem

36786
23:18:12,720 --> 23:18:16,120
set nine um stitching together all of

36787
23:18:14,960 --> 23:18:18,360
those languages and building

36788
23:18:16,120 --> 23:18:21,231
full-fledged web applications mobile

36789
23:18:18,360 --> 23:18:24,000
applications or anything more and for

36790
23:18:21,232 --> 23:18:25,872
that I think we are all set and if the

36791
23:18:24,000 --> 23:18:27,440
first one up here uh can have these

36792
23:18:25,872 --> 23:18:30,832
cookies as well we'll see you next time

36793
23:18:27,440 --> 23:18:30,832

23:20:31,600 --> 23:20:35,760
crocodillos and pitches now Sarah and I

36804
23:20:34,800 --> 23:20:37,912
understand that today is the final

36805
23:20:35,760 --> 23:20:40,640
lecture of cs50 it's been a tough

36806
23:20:37,912 --> 23:20:43,080
semester we made it through pets four

36807
23:20:40,640 --> 23:20:44,720
five and even Finance now I know this is

36808
23:20:43,080 --> 23:20:46,280
an unpopular opinion but I particularly

36809
23:20:44,720 --> 23:20:47,232
enjoyed Finance I spent a lot of time

36810
23:20:46,280 --> 23:20:52,192
with my

36811
23:20:47,232 --> 23:20:54,760
flask the P set there was a p

36812
23:20:52,192 --> 23:20:57,799
set well um at least things are looking

36813
23:20:54,760 --> 23:21:00,192
up um today is our last lecture and look

36814
23:20:57,800 --> 23:21:03,040
how far we've come if I were an emoji

36815
23:21:00,192 --> 23:21:05,000
right now I'd be the face with tears of

36816
23:21:03,040 --> 23:21:06,959
joy sorry about that we're just trying

36817
23:21:05,000 --> 23:21:09,512

36823
23:21:23,872 --> 23:21:26,512
to see if these jokes were funny when we

36824
23:21:25,120 --> 23:21:29,080
wrote

23:24:34,192 --> 23:24:41,040
PE soon deadlines I'll make it hit

36862
23:24:37,912 --> 23:24:42,610
compile and please don't break it code

36863
23:24:41,040 --> 23:24:46,269
was made by

36864
23:24:42,610 --> 23:24:46,270
[Music]

36865
23:24:46,400 --> 23:24:49,400
foru

36866
23:24:49,912 --> 23:24:58,000
I for notation I must do

36867
23:24:55,400 --> 23:24:58,000
is

36868
23:24:59,512 --> 23:25:02,960
Dam even

36869
23:25:03,960 --> 23:25:12,640
more is

[Music]

36871
23:25:22,320 --> 23:25:35,320
I is for the language 0 1 0 1 0 oh is

36872
23:25:28,232 --> 23:25:39,080
for otation 0 1 1 D is for dynamic flas

36873
23:25:35,320 --> 23:25:43,512
run and finance e is even more than

36874
23:25:39,080 --> 23:25:46,080
David mail in canor so C is all that I

36875
23:25:43,512 --> 23:25:49,912
can give to

36876
23:25:46,080 --> 23:25:53,600
you debugging it since

36877
23:25:49,912 --> 23:25:56,680
PE soon deadlines I'll make it hit

36878
23:25:53,600 --> 23:26:00,160
compile and please don't break it code

36879
23:25:56,680 --> 23:26:02,819
was made by me for COD was made by me

36880
23:26:00,160 --> 23:26:10,809
for COD was

36881
23:26:02,820 --> 23:26:10,809
[Music]

36882
23:26:13,120 --> 23:26:16,480
by all

36883
23:26:22,232 --> 23:26:25,232
right

36884
23:26:26,552 --> 23:26:33,192
all right this is cs50 and cs50 this was

36885
23:26:30,912 --> 23:26:35,040
the Harvard crocodillos and the Radcliff

36886
23:26:33,192 --> 23:26:37,832
pitches if one more time we could thank

36887
23:26:35,040 --> 23:26:37,832
them for joining us

36888
23:26:40,400 --> 23:26:46,319
today so this is already week 10 our

36889
23:26:44,400 --> 23:26:47,912
last and indeed among the goals for

36890
23:26:46,320 --> 23:26:50,000
today are to hopefully give you all the

36891
23:26:47,912 --> 23:26:52,360
more of appreciation of truly just how

36892
23:26:50,000 --> 23:26:54,360
far you've come recall that in week zero

36893
23:26:52,360 --> 23:26:56,832
we began with this this visual here

36894
23:26:54,360 --> 23:26:59,832
whereby it was described this class as a

36895
23:26:56,832 --> 23:27:01,959
bit of a fire hose whereby drinking from

36896
23:26:59,832 --> 23:27:04,360
that fire hose or really a fire hose

36897
23:27:01,960 --> 23:27:06,160
from a water fountain uh is not unlike

36898
23:27:04,360 --> 23:27:07,400
getting an education down the road too

36899
23:27:06,160 --> 23:27:09,232
and so this is to say that if you're

36900
23:27:07,400 --> 23:27:11,159
feeling like you didn't quite get it all

36901
23:27:09,232 --> 23:27:12,552
down like that's actually okay and

36902
23:27:11,160 --> 23:27:15,040
that's to be expected and even if you

36903
23:27:12,552 --> 23:27:17,440
felt that with each passing week 0 1 two

36904
23:27:15,040 --> 23:27:19,552
all the way up now till 10 it never

36905
23:27:17,440 --> 23:27:22,000
really ever got easier perhaps just

36906
23:27:19,552 --> 23:27:24,319
consider that what was once hard like

36907
23:27:22,000 --> 23:27:26,192
Mario and like getting hello world to

36908
23:27:24,320 --> 23:27:28,480
compile is indeed the right measure of

36909
23:27:26,192 --> 23:27:30,192
the Delta between week Zer and now in

36910
23:27:28,480 --> 23:27:32,800
week 10 in fact you might recall that

36911
23:27:30,192 --> 23:27:35,159
again in week zero 2third of your

36912
23:27:32,800 --> 23:27:37,280
classmates had never taken a CS course

36913
23:27:35,160 --> 23:27:38,960
before now of course you all have and

36914
23:27:37,280 --> 23:27:40,800
indeed if you think back too to this

36915
23:27:38,960 --> 23:27:42,160
final sentiment from week zero that

36916
23:27:40,800 --> 23:27:44,080
indeed what ultimately matters in this

36917
23:27:42,160 --> 23:27:45,760
course is not where you end up relative

36918
23:27:44,080 --> 23:27:48,760
to your classmates but where you end up

36919
23:27:45,760 --> 23:27:50,439
relative to where you yourself began so

36920
23:27:48,760 --> 23:27:52,120
I would take some pride take some

36921
23:27:50,440 --> 23:27:53,480
satisfaction take some relief even

36922
23:27:52,120 --> 23:27:55,040
though a little bit more work does

36923
23:27:53,480 --> 23:27:56,760
remain at really just how far you've

36924
23:27:55,040 --> 23:27:58,599
come since that week zero and recall

36925
23:27:56,760 --> 23:28:00,720
that in week zero we literally started

36926
23:27:58,600 --> 23:28:03,120
with just zeros and ones and by now many

36927
23:28:00,720 --> 23:28:04,760
of you might have gleaned that these 64

36928
23:28:03,120 --> 23:28:06,680
zeros and ones have been spelling

36929
23:28:04,760 --> 23:28:09,760
something week by week in fact today is

36930
23:28:06,680 --> 23:28:11,719
our very last message here in binary uh

36931
23:28:09,760 --> 23:28:13,360
encoded on stage but then quickly we

36932
23:28:11,720 --> 23:28:14,512
introduced scratch and we started to

36933
23:28:13,360 --> 23:28:17,600
assemble some building blocks of

36934
23:28:14,512 --> 23:28:19,040
programming Loops conditions uh uh Loops

36935
23:28:17,600 --> 23:28:20,440
conditions functions and the like but

36936
23:28:19,040 --> 23:28:22,360
without all the distractions of

36937
23:28:20,440 --> 23:28:23,832
semicolons and curly braces and all of

36938
23:28:22,360 --> 23:28:26,000
that which admittedly we introduce the

36939
23:28:23,832 --> 23:28:27,511
next week when we introduce you to C but

36940
23:28:26,000 --> 23:28:29,600
even now that we've transitioned to

36941
23:28:27,512 --> 23:28:31,232
python hopefully even those kinds of

36942
23:28:29,600 --> 23:28:32,800
Curiosities or confusions are hopefully

36943
23:28:31,232 --> 23:28:34,512
starting to just get more familiar and

36944
23:28:32,800 --> 23:28:36,680
so you finally start to see the missing

36945
23:28:34,512 --> 23:28:38,640
semicolon as opposed to spending time on

36946
23:28:36,680 --> 23:28:40,280
that kind of struggle recall too that in

36947
23:28:38,640 --> 23:28:42,080
week two we started talking already

36948
23:28:40,280 --> 23:28:44,040
about memory and like how you can manage

36949
23:28:42,080 --> 23:28:46,232
things in arrays that later became of

36950
23:28:44,040 --> 23:28:49,000
course in Python lists uh the week after

36951
23:28:46,232 --> 23:28:51,320
we talked not only about uh debugging uh

36952
23:28:49,000 --> 23:28:52,832
bugs in code but how to debug those same

36953
23:28:51,320 --> 23:28:54,080
programs um thereafter we started

36954
23:28:52,832 --> 23:28:56,159
talking talking about algorithms and we

36955
23:28:54,080 --> 23:28:57,912
took a step back from code and looked at

36956
23:28:56,160 --> 23:28:59,440
the bubble sorts and the selection sorts

36957
23:28:57,912 --> 23:29:01,192
and the merge sorts and all of the

36958
23:28:59,440 --> 23:29:02,912
searches as well that go hand in hand

36959
23:29:01,192 --> 23:29:04,280
with that and indeed this ultimately is

36960
23:29:02,912 --> 23:29:05,360
what a lot of problem solving moving

36961
23:29:04,280 --> 23:29:06,832
forward is going to be about just

36962
23:29:05,360 --> 23:29:08,832
solving problems with some form of

36963
23:29:06,832 --> 23:29:11,080
algorithm and you have so many different

36964
23:29:08,832 --> 23:29:13,120
languages um in your toolkit now with

36965
23:29:11,080 --> 23:29:15,512
which to approach problems like those we

36966
23:29:13,120 --> 23:29:17,360
talk thereafter about pointers which are

36967
23:29:15,512 --> 23:29:18,832
not likely to come back in any modern

36968
23:29:17,360 --> 23:29:20,512
languages that you now use but hopefully

36969
23:29:18,832 --> 23:29:22,159
you have an all the better of a sense

36970
23:29:20,512 --> 23:29:23,680
underneath the hood of like what's going

36971
23:29:22,160 --> 23:29:25,360
on inside of the computer so that when

36972
23:29:23,680 --> 23:29:27,000
you're designing something you're using

36973
23:29:25,360 --> 23:29:28,640
something something crashes you at least

36974
23:29:27,000 --> 23:29:31,040
have a mental model for what's going on

36975
23:29:28,640 --> 23:29:33,232
and it's no longer that week zero black

36976
23:29:31,040 --> 23:29:35,319
box as it once was I mean you built

36977
23:29:33,232 --> 23:29:37,160
things like this think back to week five

36978
23:29:35,320 --> 23:29:39,000
when you built your own hash table and

36979
23:29:37,160 --> 23:29:41,872
those things are everywhere key value

36980
23:29:39,000 --> 23:29:44,552
pairs whether it's in python or in C or

36981
23:29:41,872 --> 23:29:46,320
if it's now in CSS and JavaScript and

36982
23:29:44,552 --> 23:29:48,959
even HTML like that principle of key

36983
23:29:46,320 --> 23:29:50,600
value pairs is really everywhere and so

36984
23:29:48,960 --> 23:29:51,912
of course now code doesn't necessarily

36985
23:29:50,600 --> 23:29:53,232
have to look like this it now

36986
23:29:51,912 --> 23:29:55,080
wonderfully looks a little something

36987
23:29:53,232 --> 23:29:56,872
more like this but eventually you're

36988
23:29:55,080 --> 23:29:58,440
probably not I'm not going to use Python

36989
23:29:56,872 --> 23:30:00,400
anymore something new and better is

36990
23:29:58,440 --> 23:30:01,800
going to come along but odds are like a

36991
23:30:00,400 --> 23:30:04,079
lot of the building blocks from these

36992
23:30:01,800 --> 23:30:05,720
past 11 weeks are still going to be

36993
23:30:04,080 --> 23:30:07,960
useful for wrapping your mind around

36994
23:30:05,720 --> 23:30:09,480
those new worlds and indeed SQL we

36995
23:30:07,960 --> 23:30:11,040
introduced you a little bit too and even

36996
23:30:09,480 --> 23:30:12,720
if you don't feel yourself yet an expert

36997
23:30:11,040 --> 23:30:14,319
hopefully have a sense of like what you

36998
23:30:12,720 --> 23:30:15,960
can do with it and what problems you can

36999
23:30:14,320 --> 23:30:17,680
solve uh it's of course a better

37000
23:30:15,960 --> 23:30:19,400
alternative to something like something

37001
23:30:17,680 --> 23:30:21,079
simple like a spreadsheet and now of

37002
23:30:19,400 --> 23:30:22,640
course like web stuff is everywhere

37003
23:30:21,080 --> 23:30:25,000
whether it's on your laptop or desktop

37004
23:30:22,640 --> 23:30:27,160
or a lot of the mobile apps that you use

37005
23:30:25,000 --> 23:30:28,760
on your phone even though they're native

37006
23:30:27,160 --> 23:30:30,760
applications like you install them from

37007
23:30:28,760 --> 23:30:33,040
Google Play or the Apple App Store like

37008
23:30:30,760 --> 23:30:35,159
they're implemented increasingly with

37009
23:30:33,040 --> 23:30:36,552
HTML CSS and JavaScript but they're put

37010
23:30:35,160 --> 23:30:38,320
in a little rectangular window so you

37011
23:30:36,552 --> 23:30:40,720
don't even notice that that's actually

37012
23:30:38,320 --> 23:30:42,232
really just an embedded browser and then

37013
23:30:40,720 --> 23:30:43,800
of course you can build things as you

37014
23:30:42,232 --> 23:30:45,400
might for your final project that to

37015
23:30:43,800 --> 23:30:47,120
might very well be web based if you go

37016
23:30:45,400 --> 23:30:49,040
that route I mean I'm still clinging to

37017
23:30:47,120 --> 23:30:51,799
like the very first like web app I ever

37018
23:30:49,040 --> 23:30:54,280
made years ago um but honestly I do that

37019
23:30:51,800 --> 23:30:55,760
in part because I was just so darn proud

37020
23:30:54,280 --> 23:30:57,400
that like I taught myself how to do

37021
23:30:55,760 --> 23:30:59,040
something and it actually worked and was

37022
23:30:57,400 --> 23:31:01,192
used by other people so whether it's

37023
23:30:59,040 --> 23:31:02,832
just used by you or your classmates or

37024
23:31:01,192 --> 23:31:04,440
your roommates or your family or your

37025
23:31:02,832 --> 23:31:06,360
company down the line there's a great

37026
23:31:04,440 --> 23:31:08,360
sense of satisfaction that comes despite

37027
23:31:06,360 --> 23:31:10,800
all of the the pain that might be along

37028
23:31:08,360 --> 23:31:13,000
the way when you just can't see or fix

37029
23:31:10,800 --> 23:31:15,912
that bug now of course we'll transition

37030
23:31:13,000 --> 23:31:17,912
as you'll see in the coming days to try

37031
23:31:15,912 --> 23:31:19,599
empowering you to code client side as

37032
23:31:17,912 --> 23:31:21,680
well up until now you've been using our

37033
23:31:19,600 --> 23:31:23,080
own vs code installation in the cloud

37034
23:31:21,680 --> 23:31:25,480
which is nice cuz you got up in running

37035
23:31:23,080 --> 23:31:27,480
super fast in week one focusing only on

37036
23:31:25,480 --> 23:31:29,832
code challenges not on technical

37037
23:31:27,480 --> 23:31:31,872
difficulties but among the goals now if

37038
23:31:29,832 --> 23:31:33,120
you so choose and want to program after

37039
23:31:31,872 --> 23:31:35,120
this class even if you never take

37040
23:31:33,120 --> 23:31:37,720
another CS course before you can use

37041
23:31:35,120 --> 23:31:39,959
these same real world deao standard

37042
23:31:37,720 --> 23:31:41,760
tools on your own Mac or PC and so

37043
23:31:39,960 --> 23:31:43,552
pictured here is a screenshot of like vs

37044
23:31:41,760 --> 23:31:44,552
code on the Mac and even though yes

37045
23:31:43,552 --> 23:31:45,832
you're going to have to like jump

37046
23:31:44,552 --> 23:31:47,512
through a couple of more Hoops to just

37047
23:31:45,832 --> 23:31:49,439
get python or some other language

37048
23:31:47,512 --> 23:31:50,720
working on your own Mac or PC like

37049
23:31:49,440 --> 23:31:52,040
that's what programming is ultimately

37050
23:31:50,720 --> 23:31:54,232
going to be about and we deliberately

37051
23:31:52,040 --> 23:31:56,360
transition you to this at terms end so

37052
23:31:54,232 --> 23:31:58,080
that now you have 11 weeks of more

37053
23:31:56,360 --> 23:32:00,192
Comfort under your belt with which to

37054
23:31:58,080 --> 23:32:01,232
solve sort of silly technical support

37055
23:32:00,192 --> 23:32:03,599
headaches that might have been deal

37056
23:32:01,232 --> 23:32:05,872
breakers so many weeks ago so there's

37057
23:32:03,600 --> 23:32:07,552
still more to be done uh in the coming

37058
23:32:05,872 --> 23:32:09,760
weeks and indeed a support structure

37059
23:32:07,552 --> 23:32:12,872
there for the cs50 hackathon of course

37060
23:32:09,760 --> 23:32:14,640
will be this 700 p.m. till 7 a.m.

37061
23:32:12,872 --> 23:32:16,832
opportunity to dive into your final

37062
23:32:14,640 --> 23:32:19,080
project well really continue diving into

37063
23:32:16,832 --> 23:32:20,760
your final project ideally at that point

37064
23:32:19,080 --> 23:32:22,080
uh alongside classmates perhaps your

37065
23:32:20,760 --> 23:32:23,280
project Partners if you're working

37066
23:32:22,080 --> 23:32:25,320
collaboratively

37067
23:32:23,280 --> 23:32:26,912
uh and awaiting you will be such

37068
23:32:25,320 --> 23:32:28,192
memories and excitement hopefully as

37069
23:32:26,912 --> 23:32:29,912
these even as you then turn your

37070
23:32:28,192 --> 23:32:31,192
attention back to your final project

37071
23:32:29,912 --> 23:32:33,599
there of course will be several meals

37072
23:32:31,192 --> 23:32:36,000
during the day culminating with 500 a.m.

37073
23:32:33,600 --> 23:32:38,360
uh shuttles to IHOP the local Pancake

37074
23:32:36,000 --> 23:32:40,680
Place uh if you are so awake at that

37075
23:32:38,360 --> 23:32:42,280
point or even if you get there uh this

37076
23:32:40,680 --> 23:32:44,400
is not an uncommon site as you might

37077
23:32:42,280 --> 23:32:46,400
recall from week zero and then lastly is

37078
23:32:44,400 --> 23:32:48,120
the cs-50 fair which is finally back

37079
23:32:46,400 --> 23:32:49,640
after a couple of years now of it not

37080
23:32:48,120 --> 23:32:51,480
being on campus and this will be an

37081
23:32:49,640 --> 23:32:53,512
opportunity for everyone to present

37082
23:32:51,480 --> 23:32:55,159
their final projects to passers by

37083
23:32:53,512 --> 23:32:56,640
classmates faculty and staff and really

37084
23:32:55,160 --> 23:32:58,600
just Delight in what it is you created

37085
23:32:56,640 --> 23:33:01,000
on your Mac your PC your phone in the

37086
23:32:58,600 --> 23:33:02,552
cloud or anywhere else and indeed it's

37087
23:33:01,000 --> 23:33:04,160
just going to be an opportunity to bring

37088
23:33:02,552 --> 23:33:06,480
your laptop to a shared space or your

37089
23:33:04,160 --> 23:33:08,680
phone and introduce your project to

37090
23:33:06,480 --> 23:33:10,872
passers by such as might appear and

37091
23:33:08,680 --> 23:33:12,319
ultimately celebrate what you all uh

37092
23:33:10,872 --> 23:33:14,800
accomplished and indeed will you be

37093
23:33:12,320 --> 23:33:17,440
handed at the cs50 fair your very own I

37094
23:33:14,800 --> 23:33:20,192
took cs50 t-shirt which I dare say I'm

37095
23:33:17,440 --> 23:33:21,600
still wearing all of these years later

37096
23:33:20,192 --> 23:33:23,231
and so you

37097
23:33:21,600 --> 23:33:26,760
to

37098
23:33:23,232 --> 23:33:29,120
we'll have that uh ahead of you as well

37099
23:33:26,760 --> 23:33:30,720
so for what's on the agenda today we

37100
23:33:29,120 --> 23:33:32,231
thought we would not only look back but

37101
23:33:30,720 --> 23:33:33,832
look forward but first we wanted to

37102
23:33:32,232 --> 23:33:35,832
thank so many of the team members that

37103
23:33:33,832 --> 23:33:37,360
have been helping both on stage and off

37104
23:33:35,832 --> 23:33:39,319
who've made this course and these

37105
23:33:37,360 --> 23:33:41,440
sections and so much more about cs50

37106
23:33:39,320 --> 23:33:43,000
possible of course um the building that

37107
23:33:41,440 --> 23:33:45,080
we are now in there's a whole team

37108
23:33:43,000 --> 23:33:47,000
downstairs in Memorial Hall who helps us

37109
23:33:45,080 --> 23:33:49,000
get set up and organized each day our

37110
23:33:47,000 --> 23:33:50,360
thanks to them there's the education

37111
23:33:49,000 --> 23:33:52,192
Support Services team who makes

37112
23:33:50,360 --> 23:33:53,720
everything look and sound so well down

37113
23:33:52,192 --> 23:33:55,912
here especially when we have all of the

37114
23:33:53,720 --> 23:33:57,872
more microphones as well our friends the

37115
23:33:55,912 --> 23:33:59,760
harbard crocodillos and the redcliff

37116
23:33:57,872 --> 23:34:04,320
pitches most recently and then of course

37117
23:33:59,760 --> 23:34:06,280
cs50's own team uh but butter cs50's own

37118
23:34:04,320 --> 23:34:08,160
favorite restaurant Chang show down the

37119
23:34:06,280 --> 23:34:09,640
road indeed if you find yourself in

37120
23:34:08,160 --> 23:34:11,760
Cambridge for the next one two 3 four

37121
23:34:09,640 --> 23:34:13,360
years or visiting from out of town uh do

37122
23:34:11,760 --> 23:34:14,720
pay a visit to our friends just down the

37123
23:34:13,360 --> 23:34:16,872
road and in fact we'll have our very

37124
23:34:14,720 --> 23:34:19,480
last cs50 lunch this Friday if you're

37125
23:34:16,872 --> 23:34:22,232
able locally to partake and then there

37126
23:34:19,480 --> 23:34:24,231
cs50's own team um both on stage and off

37127
23:34:22,232 --> 23:34:26,280
in thanks truly because not only do they

37128
23:34:24,232 --> 23:34:28,160
make the everything run so smoothly they

37129
23:34:26,280 --> 23:34:29,760
capture it for students here who might

37130
23:34:28,160 --> 23:34:31,640
not be physically present here for our

37131
23:34:29,760 --> 23:34:33,192
friends down in New Haven at Yale and

37132
23:34:31,640 --> 23:34:36,872
certainly for anyone online who might be

37133
23:34:33,192 --> 23:34:39,512
tuning in as well and then lastly wanted

37134
23:34:36,872 --> 23:34:41,800
to thank of course the huge team of your

37135
23:34:39,512 --> 23:34:43,400
classmates your peers that make cs50

37136
23:34:41,800 --> 23:34:46,680
possible in sections and office hours

37137
23:34:43,400 --> 23:34:49,192
tutorials and more allow me to share

37138
23:34:46,680 --> 23:34:51,480
with you the outtakes so that even we

37139
23:34:49,192 --> 23:34:53,080
the teaching staff sometimes struggle

37140
23:34:51,480 --> 23:34:54,912
with computer science here are some of

37141
23:34:53,080 --> 23:34:57,872
the clips that we captured when just

37142
23:34:54,912 --> 23:34:59,912
passing packets via tcpip a while back

37143
23:34:57,872 --> 23:35:02,232
you saw the finally the the nicely

37144
23:34:59,912 --> 23:35:04,400
polished version but here are if I may

37145
23:35:02,232 --> 23:35:05,160
if we could dim the lights are some of

37146
23:35:04,400 --> 23:35:07,040
the

37147
23:35:05,160 --> 23:35:10,000
outakes nothing

37148
23:35:07,040 --> 23:35:12,680
go buffering

37149
23:35:10,000 --> 23:35:15,680
okay Josh

37150
23:35:12,680 --> 23:35:15,680
nice

37151
23:35:16,830 --> 23:35:24,400
[Music]

37152
23:35:19,680 --> 23:35:24,400
Helen no oh wait

37153
23:35:27,440 --> 23:35:30,160
that was amazing

37154
23:35:30,480 --> 23:35:39,288
Josh uh um

37155
23:35:34,170 --> 23:35:39,289
[Music]

37156
23:35:39,800 --> 23:35:44,360
Sophie

37157
23:35:42,320 --> 23:35:47,360
amazing that was

37158
23:35:44,360 --> 23:35:47,360
perfect

37159
23:35:48,000 --> 23:35:52,960
B I think

37160
23:35:51,000 --> 23:35:56,250
I what

37161
23:35:52,960 --> 23:35:58,600
you oh nice

37162
23:35:56,250 --> 23:36:04,000
[Music]

37163
23:35:58,600 --> 23:36:04,000
guy that was amazing thank you all so

37164
23:36:04,040 --> 23:36:07,871
good indeed and that moment if we could

37165
23:36:06,360 --> 23:36:11,000
just one round of applause for everyone

37166
23:36:07,872 --> 23:36:11,000
who's helped out this

37167
23:36:12,760 --> 23:36:19,760
semester so back in week zero uh we

37168
23:36:17,600 --> 23:36:22,080
introduced you of course to this idea of

37169
23:36:19,760 --> 23:36:23,439
computational thinking which is to think

37170
23:36:22,080 --> 23:36:25,120
a a little more methodically a little

37171
23:36:23,440 --> 23:36:26,512
more algorithmically and by way of these

37172
23:36:25,120 --> 23:36:28,040
various languages hopefully that is

37173
23:36:26,512 --> 23:36:29,720
something you notice maybe not in the

37174
23:36:28,040 --> 23:36:31,159
moment but in the months and the years

37175
23:36:29,720 --> 23:36:32,552
to come that you do find that your

37176
23:36:31,160 --> 23:36:33,832
thoughts are indeed a little more

37177
23:36:32,552 --> 23:36:35,480
cleaned up and you're just able to

37178
23:36:33,832 --> 23:36:37,720
express yourself a little more precisely

37179
23:36:35,480 --> 23:36:39,599
and even spot illogic in someone else's

37180
23:36:37,720 --> 23:36:41,232
document or statements as well but at

37181
23:36:39,600 --> 23:36:43,232
the end of the day really a course like

37182
23:36:41,232 --> 23:36:45,480
this is also about critical thinking and

37183
23:36:43,232 --> 23:36:47,232
indeed rewind again to week zero when we

37184
23:36:45,480 --> 23:36:49,319
frame the entirety of computer science

37185
23:36:47,232 --> 23:36:51,160
is really just this like problem solving

37186
23:36:49,320 --> 23:36:53,280
and any problem in the world be it CS or

37187
23:36:51,160 --> 23:36:55,160
otherwise has some input and we decided

37188
23:36:53,280 --> 23:36:57,120
how to represent those inputs it needs

37189
23:36:55,160 --> 23:36:59,192
some output the solution there too and

37190
23:36:57,120 --> 23:37:00,512
then all of what you focused on doing

37191
23:36:59,192 --> 23:37:02,512
and learning and applying these past

37192
23:37:00,512 --> 23:37:04,600
several weeks is in that proverbial

37193
23:37:02,512 --> 23:37:06,720
black box which hopefully is not such an

37194
23:37:04,600 --> 23:37:08,360
abstraction anymore but is indeed

37195
23:37:06,720 --> 23:37:10,160
something that you know how to harness

37196
23:37:08,360 --> 23:37:11,760
and know what could be going on

37197
23:37:10,160 --> 23:37:13,600
underneath the hood even if it's in some

37198
23:37:11,760 --> 23:37:15,231
technology or some language that maybe

37199
23:37:13,600 --> 23:37:17,232
we ourselves didn't cover because a lot

37200
23:37:15,232 --> 23:37:18,960
of those first principles remain the

37201
23:37:17,232 --> 23:37:20,872
same now along the way we talked about

37202
23:37:18,960 --> 23:37:22,400
the quality of solutions to those

37203
23:37:20,872 --> 23:37:24,440
problems we happen to focus on

37204
23:37:22,400 --> 23:37:26,192
correctness just does it work design

37205
23:37:24,440 --> 23:37:28,000
which is a bit more qualitative and

37206
23:37:26,192 --> 23:37:29,440
subjective and then style the Aesthetics

37207
23:37:28,000 --> 23:37:31,040
of it all and these two are

37208
23:37:29,440 --> 23:37:33,080
characteristic maybe not with these same

37209
23:37:31,040 --> 23:37:35,480
words of just how you might write or

37210
23:37:33,080 --> 23:37:37,440
evaluate other creations in life be it

37211
23:37:35,480 --> 23:37:39,512
physical or written or the like so think

37212
23:37:37,440 --> 23:37:41,080
about too as you solve problems just how

37213
23:37:39,512 --> 23:37:43,512
you can sort of frame for yourself like

37214
23:37:41,080 --> 23:37:45,640
am I doing a good job or not by

37215
23:37:43,512 --> 23:37:47,600
quantizing it along these or perhaps

37216
23:37:45,640 --> 23:37:49,552
other axes as well and we thought we'd

37217
23:37:47,600 --> 23:37:51,160
highlight just two topics from that week

37218
23:37:49,552 --> 23:37:52,680
zero that have really been manifest for

37219
23:37:51,160 --> 23:37:54,552
the past several weeks namely

37220
23:37:52,680 --> 23:37:56,552
abstraction like taking complicated

37221
23:37:54,552 --> 23:37:57,959
things and ideas and trying to simplify

37222
23:37:56,552 --> 23:37:59,440
them so that we can sort of operate at

37223
23:37:57,960 --> 23:38:01,040
this level and like solve problems we

37224
23:37:59,440 --> 23:38:04,000
care about without getting into the

37225
23:38:01,040 --> 23:38:06,120
weeds of implementation detail so to

37226
23:38:04,000 --> 23:38:07,600
speak but there's this tension because

37227
23:38:06,120 --> 23:38:09,440
you know now from all of these different

37228
23:38:07,600 --> 23:38:11,232
languages that code is fairly

37229
23:38:09,440 --> 23:38:12,872
unforgiving I mean even omitting a

37230
23:38:11,232 --> 23:38:14,912
stupid semicolon sometimes breaks

37231
23:38:12,872 --> 23:38:16,912
everything and so Precision is sort of

37232
23:38:14,912 --> 23:38:19,232
at odd sometimes with this idea of

37233
23:38:16,912 --> 23:38:21,480
leveraging abstraction and so we thought

37234
23:38:19,232 --> 23:38:23,912
we would try to tease this apart

37235
23:38:21,480 --> 23:38:26,832
especially all these Weeks Later here uh

37236
23:38:23,912 --> 23:38:28,360
with a bit of a uh live demonstration so

37237
23:38:26,832 --> 23:38:30,599
on the way in you probably all received

37238
23:38:28,360 --> 23:38:32,400
a sheet of paper if not but someone near

37239
23:38:30,600 --> 23:38:34,192
you did just tear theirs in half and

37240
23:38:32,400 --> 23:38:36,000
borrow half a sheet if you can or any

37241
23:38:34,192 --> 23:38:37,799
piece of loose leaf paper or the like

37242
23:38:36,000 --> 23:38:41,000
will suffice so long as you have a pen

37243
23:38:37,800 --> 23:38:43,760
or pencil and for this allow me to

37244
23:38:41,000 --> 23:38:47,232
propose that we invite up maybe two

37245
23:38:43,760 --> 23:38:49,192
final cs50 volunteers this semester and

37246
23:38:47,232 --> 23:38:50,720
like a lot of hands are going up in this

37247
23:38:49,192 --> 23:38:53,319
okay a lot of hands how about I saw the

37248
23:38:50,720 --> 23:38:56,760
first hand there uh yes yes who's yes

37249
23:38:53,320 --> 23:38:58,912
who's pointing at herself now come on

37250
23:38:56,760 --> 23:39:01,192
down we just need the one hand for now

37251
23:38:58,912 --> 23:39:02,872
but oh wait oh wait uh you'll be our

37252
23:39:01,192 --> 23:39:04,552
number two well okay we have way too

37253
23:39:02,872 --> 23:39:07,360
many volunteers now no no please please

37254
23:39:04,552 --> 23:39:10,512
come down yes in the black shirt and if

37255
23:39:07,360 --> 23:39:11,832
you guys we will okay we'll do pair

37256
23:39:10,512 --> 23:39:13,680
programming in just a bit if you want to

37257
23:39:11,832 --> 23:39:15,511
hang out in the wings here we'll have

37258
23:39:13,680 --> 23:39:17,231
our second demonstration as well so okay

37259
23:39:15,512 --> 23:39:19,552
now maybe a round of applause for our

37260
23:39:17,232 --> 23:39:19,552
three

37261
23:39:21,040 --> 23:39:26,599
volunteers oh come on up first oh second

37262
23:39:24,832 --> 23:39:30,000
and third okay you come first we'll do

37263
23:39:26,600 --> 23:39:31,800
order no uh this is a q okay Q here okay

37264
23:39:30,000 --> 23:39:34,400
what's your name I'm Danny Danny okay

37265
23:39:31,800 --> 23:39:36,120
take this mic okay so we will DQ you

37266
23:39:34,400 --> 23:39:38,480
momentarily all right so Danny come on

37267
23:39:36,120 --> 23:39:40,640
over to the middle here and in a moment

37268
23:39:38,480 --> 23:39:42,640
I'm going to hand to Danny a sheet of

37269
23:39:40,640 --> 23:39:43,912
paper that has a picture on it and this

37270
23:39:42,640 --> 23:39:45,680
picture is going to be something that

37271
23:39:43,912 --> 23:39:49,040
I'd like you to verbally program the

37272
23:39:45,680 --> 23:39:50,832
audience to draw you can use any words

37273
23:39:49,040 --> 23:39:52,280
any abstractions any PR level of

37274
23:39:50,832 --> 23:39:54,192
precision that you want but you just

37275
23:39:52,280 --> 23:39:56,000
can't make hand gestures or sort of show

37276
23:39:54,192 --> 23:39:57,280
them what to draw But first you want to

37277
23:39:56,000 --> 23:39:59,760
tell us a little something about

37278
23:39:57,280 --> 23:40:03,400
yourself including everyone here I'm

37279
23:39:59,760 --> 23:40:05,640
daddy and I took ts50 okay wonderful

37280
23:40:03,400 --> 23:40:08,040
wonderful so I'm going to reveal the

37281
23:40:05,640 --> 23:40:09,232
picture only to Danny and if each of you

37282
23:40:08,040 --> 23:40:10,871
would like to take out that sheet of

37283
23:40:09,232 --> 23:40:12,720
paper and just make sure that no one

37284
23:40:10,872 --> 23:40:15,360
else can see this if you want to hold it

37285
23:40:12,720 --> 23:40:17,320
up this way everyone here is now holding

37286
23:40:15,360 --> 23:40:19,440
their pen or pencil and in some number

37287
23:40:17,320 --> 23:40:21,120
of steps give them a verbal algorithm

37288
23:40:19,440 --> 23:40:23,400
for drawing what you see and you can say

37289
23:40:21,120 --> 23:40:25,400
anything you want but no gestures okay

37290
23:40:23,400 --> 23:40:30,280
so you're going to want to

37291
23:40:25,400 --> 23:40:31,599
draw a square in the center of the paper

37292
23:40:30,280 --> 23:40:34,512
with the

37293
23:40:31,600 --> 23:40:38,360
diagonal pointing to

37294
23:40:34,512 --> 23:40:38,360
the center of the

37295
23:40:39,480 --> 23:40:47,800
edge wait no actually I scratched that

37296
23:40:43,232 --> 23:40:47,800
draw a rbus in the center of your

37297
23:40:48,080 --> 23:40:53,280
paper and for those who forget what a

37298
23:40:50,192 --> 23:40:57,799
rhombus is for um a d

37299
23:40:53,280 --> 23:41:02,319
Diamond a a square that's on its

37300
23:40:57,800 --> 23:41:04,912
side and then from the bottom vertex

37301
23:41:02,320 --> 23:41:08,320
draw a straight line down but not all

37302
23:41:04,912 --> 23:41:08,319
the way to the edge of the

37303
23:41:08,720 --> 23:41:14,800
paper okay and then keep your pencil or

37304
23:41:12,512 --> 23:41:18,912
pen at that point and you're going to

37305
23:41:14,800 --> 23:41:23,872
want to draw a line that's parallel to

37306
23:41:18,912 --> 23:41:23,872
the line of the original rumus to the

37307
23:41:24,960 --> 23:41:30,320
right and then keep your pencil or pen

37308
23:41:27,912 --> 23:41:33,912
at that point and draw a line straight

37309
23:41:30,320 --> 23:41:33,912
up connecting to the side

37310
23:41:35,600 --> 23:41:42,160
vertex yes and then go back to the line

37311
23:41:39,760 --> 23:41:45,640
that you drew from the bottom vertex to

37312
23:41:42,160 --> 23:41:50,552
the bottom of the paper and then draw a

37313
23:41:45,640 --> 23:41:53,040
line parallel to the left edge of the

37314
23:41:50,552 --> 23:41:55,720
rumus and then then keep your L your

37315
23:41:53,040 --> 23:42:02,000
paper your pencil at that point and draw

37316
23:41:55,720 --> 23:42:02,000
a line up to the vertex of the rumus

37317
23:42:03,000 --> 23:42:07,960
again the end the end all right well

37318
23:42:05,800 --> 23:42:09,480
thank you to Danny hang on to your paper

37319
23:42:07,960 --> 23:42:11,080
thank you so much and if you want to

37320
23:42:09,480 --> 23:42:13,192
step off to the stage there we will

37321
23:42:11,080 --> 23:42:16,400
reveal thank you a round of applause if

37322
23:42:13,192 --> 23:42:19,159
we could for Danny that is not an easy

37323
23:42:16,400 --> 23:42:21,079
task I'm sure and if Carter wouldn't

37324
23:42:19,160 --> 23:42:22,280
mind just grabbing a few samples here

37325
23:42:21,080 --> 23:42:23,680
let's actually take a look on the

37326
23:42:22,280 --> 23:42:25,280
overhead if we could I'm going to pop

37327
23:42:23,680 --> 23:42:26,599
down over here real fast we don't need

37328
23:42:25,280 --> 23:42:28,912
to collect them all but if you're

37329
23:42:26,600 --> 23:42:32,552
feeling either good or bad with what you

37330
23:42:28,912 --> 23:42:36,040
drew happy to collect a few of them

37331
23:42:32,552 --> 23:42:38,319
okay okay thank you thank

37332
23:42:36,040 --> 23:42:40,760
you okay hope you won't mind if I can't

37333
23:42:38,320 --> 23:42:45,760
reach everyone just a couple more okay

37334
23:42:40,760 --> 23:42:47,832
over here okay all right that's that's

37335
23:42:45,760 --> 23:42:49,120
okay this one's really funny okay I'm

37336
23:42:47,832 --> 23:42:50,760
going to go with this one if I may and

37337
23:42:49,120 --> 23:42:53,760
Carter has some

37338
23:42:50,760 --> 23:42:53,760
too

37339
23:42:54,640 --> 23:43:01,160
okay thank you so much okay so just a

37340
23:42:59,192 --> 23:43:04,360
random assortment here let me turn on a

37341
23:43:01,160 --> 23:43:08,440
camera so I can show you what I see here

37342
23:43:04,360 --> 23:43:10,120
for instance is one classmate drawing

37343
23:43:08,440 --> 23:43:14,232
which might resemble perhaps what you

37344
23:43:10,120 --> 23:43:16,192
drew here uh here is the beginnings of a

37345
23:43:14,232 --> 23:43:19,400
house it

37346
23:43:16,192 --> 23:43:23,680
seems nice this

37347
23:43:19,400 --> 23:43:25,159
one okay this one is larger

37348
23:43:23,680 --> 23:43:28,640
and how about a couple of others that

37349
23:43:25,160 --> 23:43:31,320
were getting closer I think okay so more

37350
23:43:28,640 --> 23:43:33,912
edges and vertices there this one seems

37351
23:43:31,320 --> 23:43:36,960
a little similar in

37352
23:43:33,912 --> 23:43:41,120
spirit if not

37353
23:43:36,960 --> 23:43:43,960
proportional this is uh Zach's the best

37354
23:43:41,120 --> 23:43:46,000
one but it turns out if I may Zach

37355
23:43:43,960 --> 23:43:48,800
you're not all that far off here Denny

37356
23:43:46,000 --> 23:43:51,160
is what you were reciting to everyone

37357
23:43:48,800 --> 23:43:52,640
algorithmically indeed it was this here

37358
23:43:51,160 --> 23:43:54,040
Cube and so Danny can you come on back

37359
23:43:52,640 --> 23:43:56,800
up for a

37360
23:43:54,040 --> 23:43:58,079
moment so if you'd like to share for

37361
23:43:56,800 --> 23:43:59,192
just a moment like what were some of the

37362
23:43:58,080 --> 23:44:01,680
thoughts going through your head and why

37363
23:43:59,192 --> 23:44:03,720
did you choose the words that you did

37364
23:44:01,680 --> 23:44:06,799
okay so what was going through my head

37365
23:44:03,720 --> 23:44:10,040
when I saw the cube um I didn't know if

37366
23:44:06,800 --> 23:44:12,800
I could say draw Cube so I decided to

37367
23:44:10,040 --> 23:44:14,719
start with the top and so draw a Remus

37368
23:44:12,800 --> 23:44:18,192
in the center of your paper and then

37369
23:44:14,720 --> 23:44:21,232
draw a line down and just like do the

37370
23:44:18,192 --> 23:44:23,120
first part then the second part then the

37371
23:44:21,232 --> 23:44:25,872
third part and then you would get a cube

37372
23:44:23,120 --> 23:44:27,912
like Zach yeah and so had you said and

37373
23:44:25,872 --> 23:44:29,512
you could have said draw a cube which

37374
23:44:27,912 --> 23:44:30,959
would be more of an abstraction even

37375
23:44:29,512 --> 23:44:31,960
that's not necessarily sufficiently

37376
23:44:30,960 --> 23:44:33,912
precise right because you don't

37377
23:44:31,960 --> 23:44:35,360
necessarily know what the orientation of

37378
23:44:33,912 --> 23:44:36,912
that cube is the size of it the

37379
23:44:35,360 --> 23:44:38,400
positioning on the paper so you instead

37380
23:44:36,912 --> 23:44:39,720
took a lower level approach which is not

37381
23:44:38,400 --> 23:44:41,400
unlike scratch if you think about

37382
23:44:39,720 --> 23:44:43,720
scratch being able to move up down left

37383
23:44:41,400 --> 23:44:45,231
right turn 90 degrees turn 15 degrees

37384
23:44:43,720 --> 23:44:47,080
and the like I mean that is ultimately

37385
23:44:45,232 --> 23:44:48,800
how a lot of graphical programs and

37386
23:44:47,080 --> 23:44:50,360
games even might be implemented by

37387
23:44:48,800 --> 23:44:51,640
really focusing at the level you do but

37388
23:44:50,360 --> 23:44:53,800
of course there's this tension with us

37389
23:44:51,640 --> 23:44:55,319
humans whereby we prefer often to think

37390
23:44:53,800 --> 23:44:56,800
at this level but even that might not be

37391
23:44:55,320 --> 23:44:59,000
sufficient which is to say here in week

37392
23:44:56,800 --> 23:45:01,360
10 like these are still going to be in

37393
23:44:59,000 --> 23:45:02,600
our hard problems uh but a hand if we

37394
23:45:01,360 --> 23:45:05,040
could one more time for Danny for

37395
23:45:02,600 --> 23:45:07,400
getting us that far along thank you so

37396
23:45:05,040 --> 23:45:09,480
much let me give you a stress ball here

37397
23:45:07,400 --> 23:45:12,680
all right and if we could have both of

37398
23:45:09,480 --> 23:45:16,231
our volunteers come up here we're going

37399
23:45:12,680 --> 23:45:17,871
to have yes come on up come on up and

37400
23:45:16,232 --> 23:45:19,872
let me uh have you guys introduce

37401
23:45:17,872 --> 23:45:22,960
yourselves in the middle

37402
23:45:19,872 --> 23:45:24,680
here hi I'm

37403
23:45:22,960 --> 23:45:27,120
hey there I'm sadik from Turkey nice to

37404
23:45:24,680 --> 23:45:29,760
meet you all wonderful welcome and this

37405
23:45:27,120 --> 23:45:31,959
time we're going to flip it around so as

37406
23:45:29,760 --> 23:45:34,400
to have the audience do what Danny just

37407
23:45:31,960 --> 23:45:35,960
did for us the only catch here is that

37408
23:45:34,400 --> 23:45:37,832
the only means we have for showing the

37409
23:45:35,960 --> 23:45:39,600
audience what they need to tell you to

37410
23:45:37,832 --> 23:45:41,959
draw is like literally right above the

37411
23:45:39,600 --> 23:45:43,680
chalkboard so on our system here that

37412
23:45:41,960 --> 23:45:46,000
your eyes must stay on the chalkboard

37413
23:45:43,680 --> 23:45:47,719
and not look up and in just a moment if

37414
23:45:46,000 --> 23:45:50,552
you guys want to both stand in front of

37415
23:45:47,720 --> 23:45:52,000
the chalkboard back to the audience and

37416
23:45:50,552 --> 23:45:53,400
as you're talking with each other other

37417
23:45:52,000 --> 23:45:55,232
verbalize it through the microphone if

37418
23:45:53,400 --> 23:45:57,159
you will I'm going to show everyone else

37419
23:45:55,232 --> 23:45:59,000
in the room a second and final drawing

37420
23:45:57,160 --> 23:46:00,680
and we'll just go rapid fire around the

37421
23:45:59,000 --> 23:46:02,232
room give us one step at a time

37422
23:46:00,680 --> 23:46:05,799
collectively and we'll see if these guys

37423
23:46:02,232 --> 23:46:07,160
can't draw exactly that same outcome so

37424
23:46:05,800 --> 23:46:08,960
is there another chunk what's that is

37425
23:46:07,160 --> 23:46:10,440
there another chunk or just just the one

37426
23:46:08,960 --> 23:46:15,360
so you'll have to collaborate and let's

37427
23:46:10,440 --> 23:46:18,760
give you a clean slate here

37428
23:46:15,360 --> 23:46:20,720
literally all right so no looking up

37429
23:46:18,760 --> 23:46:23,231
that's the only rule for you guys here

37430
23:46:20,720 --> 23:46:26,832
we go for the audience here is what we'd

37431
23:46:23,232 --> 23:46:30,120
like them ironically to

37432
23:46:26,832 --> 23:46:35,080
draw step one from anyone in the

37433
23:46:30,120 --> 23:46:39,120
audience yes draw a circle draw a circle

37434
23:46:35,080 --> 23:46:39,120
anywhere not anywhere not

37435
23:46:41,440 --> 23:46:47,760
anywhere okay that's step one step two

37436
23:46:44,512 --> 23:46:47,760
someone else yeah in the

37437
23:46:50,400 --> 23:46:54,552
middle

37438
23:46:52,760 --> 23:46:56,511
draw a line down from the bottom of the

37439
23:46:54,552 --> 23:46:59,872
circle about halfway down I think there

37440
23:46:56,512 --> 23:46:59,872
was a hand in front of you too number

37441
23:47:07,912 --> 23:47:10,912
three

37442
23:47:10,920 --> 23:47:15,080
[Music]

37443
23:47:12,760 --> 23:47:18,040
okay okay the overarching goal here for

37444
23:47:15,080 --> 23:47:22,320
those unable here is to draw a person

37445
23:47:18,040 --> 23:47:25,799
fig okay it may be a SI figure draw the

37446
23:47:22,320 --> 23:47:30,680
left leg of the person of this person

37447
23:47:25,800 --> 23:47:32,360
okay good job all right next step four

37448
23:47:30,680 --> 23:47:36,159
yeah

37449
23:47:32,360 --> 23:47:39,832
of line up Circle

37450
23:47:36,160 --> 23:47:42,320
okay the left oh sorry to the right draw

37451
23:47:39,832 --> 23:47:44,720
a v okay to the right of the vertex at

37452
23:47:42,320 --> 23:47:48,552
the bottom of the circle draw a v draw a

37453
23:47:44,720 --> 23:47:53,320
v um like what V nope not interactive

37454
23:47:48,552 --> 23:47:53,319
draw a v um no no

37455
23:47:54,720 --> 23:48:00,640
well yeah it seems Weir

37456
23:47:58,120 --> 23:48:02,280
weird let's get ready for maybe

37457
23:48:00,640 --> 23:48:05,000
something like step

37458
23:48:02,280 --> 23:48:08,192
five okay we'll go with that step five

37459
23:48:05,000 --> 23:48:09,760
someone else step five someone else

37460
23:48:08,192 --> 23:48:13,832
someone else

37461
23:48:09,760 --> 23:48:19,192
yeah draw the right side of the leg okay

37462
23:48:13,832 --> 23:48:23,231
nice step six step six happy face six

37463
23:48:19,192 --> 23:48:23,231
six yes erase the line

37464
23:48:24,040 --> 23:48:29,079
erase the line that you have on the left

37465
23:48:27,552 --> 23:48:33,159
on the

37466
23:48:29,080 --> 23:48:35,512
okay okay step seven yes instead of like

37467
23:48:33,160 --> 23:48:37,280
that line that was before going up make

37468
23:48:35,512 --> 23:48:40,640
it go down instead of that line before

37469
23:48:37,280 --> 23:48:45,800
going up make it go down mhm okay step

37470
23:48:40,640 --> 23:48:47,912
eight step eight step eight yes connect

37471
23:48:45,800 --> 23:48:51,232
that line to the hip connect that line

37472
23:48:47,912 --> 23:48:53,360
to the hip not like not touching not

37473
23:48:51,232 --> 23:48:57,160
touching something like this

37474
23:48:53,360 --> 23:49:00,232
maybe okay compromise not touching okay

37475
23:48:57,160 --> 23:49:03,720
not touching okay all right step nine

37476
23:49:00,232 --> 23:49:03,720
almost there I think step

37477
23:49:05,000 --> 23:49:09,280
nine step nine step nine yes in

37478
23:49:14,120 --> 23:49:19,832
back uh write the word high on the top

37479
23:49:17,000 --> 23:49:22,000
left of the circle

37480
23:49:19,832 --> 23:49:25,680
here okay

37481
23:49:22,000 --> 23:49:28,192
and step 10 almost there line draw a

37482
23:49:25,680 --> 23:49:30,231
line pointing to high so like a spee

37483
23:49:28,192 --> 23:49:34,192
bubble basically

37484
23:49:30,232 --> 23:49:36,912
yeah okay and step uh 10

37485
23:49:34,192 --> 23:49:41,832
11

37486
23:49:36,912 --> 23:49:43,959
yeah erase the exclamation point nice 12

37487
23:49:41,832 --> 23:49:49,832
do we want to give them one

37488
23:49:43,960 --> 23:49:52,912
more 12 or we good yeah last one erase

37489
23:49:49,832 --> 23:49:55,080
the erase erace the right arm okay I

37490
23:49:52,912 --> 23:49:57,959
think we're going to need a 13

37491
23:49:55,080 --> 23:50:01,400
then and

37492
23:49:57,960 --> 23:50:03,872
then yeah

37493
23:50:01,400 --> 23:50:06,040
repat repeat the left arm but rotate it

37494
23:50:03,872 --> 23:50:06,040
by

37495
23:50:07,680 --> 23:50:11,192
90° that feels

37496
23:50:11,320 --> 23:50:16,872
wrong wait how would you like as an

37497
23:50:13,600 --> 23:50:18,760
organic human being how put your

37498
23:50:16,872 --> 23:50:20,120
arms like would you put your would you

37499
23:50:18,760 --> 23:50:22,832
ever structure your arm like that that

37500
23:50:20,120 --> 23:50:25,192
would not be a stick

37501
23:50:22,832 --> 23:50:29,000
figure CU would you do this or would you

37502
23:50:25,192 --> 23:50:32,231
do that or a little hint maybe get a get

37503
23:50:29,000 --> 23:50:34,192
a give me a step 14 step 14 and final

37504
23:50:32,232 --> 23:50:36,192
step

37505
23:50:34,192 --> 23:50:40,192
14 I think we just got to tell them what

37506
23:50:36,192 --> 23:50:40,192
to do step 14

37507
23:50:48,000 --> 23:50:55,720
yes think of a walking man

37508
23:50:51,912 --> 23:50:59,080
and and have the left the right hand

37509
23:50:55,720 --> 23:51:02,080
walking to your right all right so like

37510
23:50:59,080 --> 23:51:04,400
it's like where could the hand go where

37511
23:51:02,080 --> 23:51:09,360
should the hand go on that

37512
23:51:04,400 --> 23:51:12,120
arm but yeah yeah okay yes

37513
23:51:09,360 --> 23:51:14,480
no yeah I mean look look look like right

37514
23:51:12,120 --> 23:51:18,912
here look right here look right I yes

37515
23:51:14,480 --> 23:51:18,912
sorry thank you 14

37516
23:51:19,120 --> 23:51:23,512
St that's pretty close so

37517
23:51:21,360 --> 23:51:26,360
congratulations to you guys and thank

37518
23:51:23,512 --> 23:51:28,280
you as well all right so I mean these

37519
23:51:26,360 --> 23:51:31,480
these things too are not yes Round of

37520
23:51:28,280 --> 23:51:31,480
Applause then sure

37521
23:51:32,280 --> 23:51:38,480
so so this is to say that these ideas of

37522
23:51:36,080 --> 23:51:40,160
abstraction and precision and really

37523
23:51:38,480 --> 23:51:42,000
every other term of art that we explored

37524
23:51:40,160 --> 23:51:43,832
this term are sort of omnipresent and

37525
23:51:42,000 --> 23:51:46,160
can be easier or harder to implement

37526
23:51:43,832 --> 23:51:48,439
depending on exactly what the problem is

37527
23:51:46,160 --> 23:51:50,680
but what we thought we' do now in our uh

37528
23:51:48,440 --> 23:51:53,120
final day is try to now similarly

37529
23:51:50,680 --> 23:51:56,400
prepare prepare you for life after cs50

37530
23:51:53,120 --> 23:51:58,440
and this is really going to be a list of

37531
23:51:56,400 --> 23:52:00,192
really potential to-dos so that you can

37532
23:51:58,440 --> 23:52:02,280
stand on your own after the class after

37533
23:52:00,192 --> 23:52:04,360
the class's infrastructure write actual

37534
23:52:02,280 --> 23:52:06,160
code and then we'll come full circle one

37535
23:52:04,360 --> 23:52:08,120
final time with our friend Jennifer 8

37536
23:52:06,160 --> 23:52:10,000
Lee to look at the world of emojis and

37537
23:52:08,120 --> 23:52:12,040
how they relate to all forms of

37538
23:52:10,000 --> 23:52:14,480
representation that we've talked to uh

37539
23:52:12,040 --> 23:52:16,959
talked about up until now so one how can

37540
23:52:14,480 --> 23:52:18,640
you go about programming after cs50 so

37541
23:52:16,960 --> 23:52:21,280
one you can actually install command

37542
23:52:18,640 --> 23:52:23,040
line tools on your own Mac or PC perhaps

37543
23:52:21,280 --> 23:52:25,232
unbeknownst to you Windows has what's

37544
23:52:23,040 --> 23:52:27,319
generally called a command prompt Mac OS

37545
23:52:25,232 --> 23:52:29,480
literally comes with a terminal program

37546
23:52:27,320 --> 23:52:30,760
in your applications utilities folder

37547
23:52:29,480 --> 23:52:32,512
and so even if you've never run those

37548
23:52:30,760 --> 23:52:34,599
programs you've actually had a sort of

37549
23:52:32,512 --> 23:52:36,232
blinking cursor black and white prompt

37550
23:52:34,600 --> 23:52:38,440
available to you might not have all of

37551
23:52:36,232 --> 23:52:40,160
the same software installed as your code

37552
23:52:38,440 --> 23:52:41,720
space in the cloud but you have that

37553
23:52:40,160 --> 23:52:43,512
command line interface even within

37554
23:52:41,720 --> 23:52:45,400
today's graphical tools and among the

37555
23:52:43,512 --> 23:52:47,040
tools you can install within that

37556
23:52:45,400 --> 23:52:48,799
command line interface would be

37557
23:52:47,040 --> 23:52:51,000
something called xcode on the Mac which

37558
23:52:48,800 --> 23:52:52,440
comes not only with a guey IDE

37559
23:52:51,000 --> 23:52:54,040
integrated development environment but

37560
23:52:52,440 --> 23:52:55,760
also those command line tools and

37561
23:52:54,040 --> 23:52:58,400
Microsoft for Windows has something

37562
23:52:55,760 --> 23:53:00,832
similar as well learning git so we've

37563
23:52:58,400 --> 23:53:02,319
used git only unbeknownst to you

37564
23:53:00,832 --> 23:53:05,231
underneath the hood for the most part

37565
23:53:02,320 --> 23:53:06,600
but git is a very very popular tool if

37566
23:53:05,232 --> 23:53:08,760
challenging to pick up for the first

37567
23:53:06,600 --> 23:53:10,480
time that makes it easy to push code to

37568
23:53:08,760 --> 23:53:12,360
a website called GitHub or any

37569
23:53:10,480 --> 23:53:13,959
equivalent and then collaborate more

37570
23:53:12,360 --> 23:53:15,192
effectively with classmates there's

37571
23:53:13,960 --> 23:53:17,040
definitely a bit of a learning curve but

37572
23:53:15,192 --> 23:53:18,640
thanks to cs50's own Brian youu you can

37573
23:53:17,040 --> 23:53:20,079
start for instance with a video like

37574
23:53:18,640 --> 23:53:21,720
this and this indeed is going to be one

37575
23:53:20,080 --> 23:53:23,080
of these deao standards in the real

37576
23:53:21,720 --> 23:53:25,160
world at least for the next several

37577
23:53:23,080 --> 23:53:27,280
years that you'll probably encounter if

37578
23:53:25,160 --> 23:53:29,232
you work in Tech or really any company

37579
23:53:27,280 --> 23:53:30,720
where you're doing some programming vs

37580
23:53:29,232 --> 23:53:32,120
code itself will walk you through this

37581
23:53:30,720 --> 23:53:34,512
process in the coming days but you can

37582
23:53:32,120 --> 23:53:36,280
indeed install it on your own Mac or PC

37583
23:53:34,512 --> 23:53:37,960
and what can you do when you write code

37584
23:53:36,280 --> 23:53:40,160
well you can certainly write software

37585
23:53:37,960 --> 23:53:42,600
for your Mac for your PC for your phone

37586
23:53:40,160 --> 23:53:44,960
or of course per week 10 uh week nine

37587
23:53:42,600 --> 23:53:48,872
you can host uh your own website be it

37588
23:53:44,960 --> 23:53:50,512
static as in week uh week eight um

37589
23:53:48,872 --> 23:53:51,800
hosting it at websites like these which

37590
23:53:50,512 --> 23:53:53,640
gener generally have free or

37591
23:53:51,800 --> 23:53:55,320
student-friendly accounts via which you

37592
23:53:53,640 --> 23:53:57,192
can put something statically on the web

37593
23:53:55,320 --> 23:53:59,120
at a real domain name that you might

37594
23:53:57,192 --> 23:54:02,480
choose or you can host a full-fledged

37595
23:53:59,120 --> 23:54:04,552
web app and using uh student tiers on

37596
23:54:02,480 --> 23:54:06,872
Amazon and Microsoft and Google's cloud

37597
23:54:04,552 --> 23:54:09,080
services or others you can sign up for

37598
23:54:06,872 --> 23:54:11,440
being a student certainly a whole lot of

37599
23:54:09,080 --> 23:54:13,912
free software free hosting so as to if

37600
23:54:11,440 --> 23:54:15,800
nothing else um experiment and uh

37601
23:54:13,912 --> 23:54:17,480
perhaps maximally get your own app or

37602
23:54:15,800 --> 23:54:19,440
website up and running so know that

37603
23:54:17,480 --> 23:54:22,480
those are resources available to you and

37604
23:54:19,440 --> 23:54:24,480
this is by uh certainly a non-exhaustive

37605
23:54:22,480 --> 23:54:26,120
list if you'd like to geek out in the

37606
23:54:24,480 --> 23:54:28,280
coming months in the coming years these

37607
23:54:26,120 --> 23:54:30,319
are just some of the places that people

37608
23:54:28,280 --> 23:54:32,360
who take computer science classes who

37609
23:54:30,320 --> 23:54:34,552
write code might tend to hang out and

37610
23:54:32,360 --> 23:54:36,480
ask and answer questions of each other

37611
23:54:34,552 --> 23:54:38,080
um so keep an eye for instance on these

37612
23:54:36,480 --> 23:54:39,800
here and then cs50 has its own

37613
23:54:38,080 --> 23:54:41,680
communities as you'll see if you go to

37614
23:54:39,800 --> 23:54:43,232
this URL here via the open coreware

37615
23:54:41,680 --> 23:54:46,159
version of cs50 which is open to the

37616
23:54:43,232 --> 23:54:47,640
world do uh is there a Vibrant Community

37617
23:54:46,160 --> 23:54:50,400
uh thanks to time zones that's pretty

37618
23:54:47,640 --> 23:54:52,480
much active 247 365 talking about not

37619
23:54:50,400 --> 23:54:54,360
only cs50 going on in problem sets and

37620
23:54:52,480 --> 23:54:56,192
projects but really technology more

37621
23:54:54,360 --> 23:54:58,400
generally as well so certainly feel

37622
23:54:56,192 --> 23:55:01,159
welcome to partake either asking or

37623
23:54:58,400 --> 23:55:02,760
answering questions now in speaking of

37624
23:55:01,160 --> 23:55:04,760
asking and answering questions a couple

37625
23:55:02,760 --> 23:55:07,000
of weeks ago you kindly gave us a whole

37626
23:55:04,760 --> 23:55:08,552
bunch of review questions which we

37627
23:55:07,000 --> 23:55:10,832
called through and picked out our

37628
23:55:08,552 --> 23:55:12,599
favorite 20 of them these of course were

37629
23:55:10,832 --> 23:55:14,959
multiple choice questions and in

37630
23:55:12,600 --> 23:55:17,120
preparation for this week uh in

37631
23:55:14,960 --> 23:55:19,680
preparation for life ahead we thought we

37632
23:55:17,120 --> 23:55:21,912
would choreograph a bit of a a quiz show

37633
23:55:19,680 --> 23:55:24,000
here and ceed as you came in at the

37634
23:55:21,912 --> 23:55:26,480
start of class you might recall being

37635
23:55:24,000 --> 23:55:28,960
invited to go to this URL here

37636
23:55:26,480 --> 23:55:32,832
cs50. either here in person or if you're

37637
23:55:28,960 --> 23:55:36,000
watching live from home at this URL here

37638
23:55:32,832 --> 23:55:37,720
you can use a phone or a laptop and if

37639
23:55:36,000 --> 23:55:41,600
it's easier on a phone you can point

37640
23:55:37,720 --> 23:55:43,280
your camera at this 2D barcode here

37641
23:55:41,600 --> 23:55:48,280
we'll give folks a moment to pull that

37642
23:55:43,280 --> 23:55:48,280
up and again that URL was cs50.

37643
23:55:49,600 --> 23:55:54,040
l/p

37644
23:55:51,480 --> 23:55:58,552
and once it looks like most folks have

37645
23:55:54,040 --> 23:56:01,760
it up and running our friend Carter here

37646
23:55:58,552 --> 23:56:04,192
will help us dive into this uh review

37647
23:56:01,760 --> 23:56:05,799
session if you will with a bit of fun

37648
23:56:04,192 --> 23:56:08,599
along the way all right Carter if you'd

37649
23:56:05,800 --> 23:56:10,000
like to take it away what do we have as

37650
23:56:08,600 --> 23:56:11,960
our first question you should see on

37651
23:56:10,000 --> 23:56:13,400
your phone or laptop this same question

37652
23:56:11,960 --> 23:56:16,232
being asked the first question is how do

37653
23:56:13,400 --> 23:56:19,231
you print quote un quote hello world in

37654
23:56:16,232 --> 23:56:22,040
Python so among the possible answers are

37655
23:56:19,232 --> 23:56:25,800
these here

37656
23:56:22,040 --> 23:56:25,799
buzz in on your phone or your

37657
23:56:26,320 --> 23:56:29,680
laptop we've got a few hundred responses

37658
23:56:28,872 --> 23:56:34,120
are

37659
23:56:29,680 --> 23:56:34,120
ready 7 Seconds to make your

37660
23:56:34,360 --> 23:56:38,680
decision this is question one of 20 go

37661
23:56:37,232 --> 23:56:41,080
to it with some confidence I think we're

37662
23:56:38,680 --> 23:56:44,799
down to zero on the clock and Carter it

37663
23:56:41,080 --> 23:56:46,552
looks like 98% of you uh indeed said

37664
23:56:44,800 --> 23:56:48,800
hello world and Carter per the check

37665
23:56:46,552 --> 23:56:50,872
mark That's indeed the correct answer

37666
23:56:48,800 --> 23:56:52,832
here now to make things interesting in

37667
23:56:50,872 --> 23:56:54,552
know that you'll see some number of

37668
23:56:52,832 --> 23:56:56,832
points and we've deliberately anonymized

37669
23:56:54,552 --> 23:56:58,552
it so only you know what number you are

37670
23:56:56,832 --> 23:57:01,280
so a whole lot of guests have a perfect

37671
23:56:58,552 --> 23:57:02,512
score of 1,000 at the moment hopefully

37672
23:57:01,280 --> 23:57:05,232
we'll see over the next several

37673
23:57:02,512 --> 23:57:07,440
questions things start to bridge out uh

37674
23:57:05,232 --> 23:57:09,552
but know that the speed with which you

37675
23:57:07,440 --> 23:57:11,960
buzz in will also factor into how many

37676
23:57:09,552 --> 23:57:13,760
points you now get So the faster you

37677
23:57:11,960 --> 23:57:17,512
move the more points you get question

37678
23:57:13,760 --> 23:57:19,159
two if we could what does DNS stand for

37679
23:57:17,512 --> 23:57:22,000
from just a couple of weeks back domain

37680
23:57:19,160 --> 23:57:24,160
number system domain name system data

37681
23:57:22,000 --> 23:57:26,480
numbering structure or there's no such

37682
23:57:24,160 --> 23:57:29,600
thing as

37683
23:57:26,480 --> 23:57:33,159
DNS few hundred responses are

37684
23:57:29,600 --> 23:57:35,800
in 8 seconds

37685
23:57:33,160 --> 23:57:39,720
remain fewer points now but still a

37686
23:57:35,800 --> 23:57:41,552
chance to buzz in and now as we hit zero

37687
23:57:39,720 --> 23:57:44,040
the responses are these domain name

37688
23:57:41,552 --> 23:57:46,552
system which is indeed correct and 84%

37689
23:57:44,040 --> 23:57:48,319
of you got that one correctly and indeed

37690
23:57:46,552 --> 23:57:50,280
exists we talked about it a couple of

37691
23:57:48,320 --> 23:57:52,160
weeks ago so we're still seeing a whole

37692
23:57:50,280 --> 23:57:54,040
lot lot of ties at 2,000 we'll see if

37693
23:57:52,160 --> 23:57:56,280
someone starts to pull away before long

37694
23:57:54,040 --> 23:57:57,799
question three what is the upper bound

37695
23:57:56,280 --> 23:58:00,192
of merge sorts

37696
23:57:57,800 --> 23:58:05,280
runtime so that escalated

37697
23:58:00,192 --> 23:58:09,832
quickly Big O of n log n Big O of log n

37698
23:58:05,280 --> 23:58:12,760
Theta or Omega of log n or Big O of

37699
23:58:09,832 --> 23:58:14,040
one what is the upper bound of merge

37700
23:58:12,760 --> 23:58:15,959
sorts

37701
23:58:14,040 --> 23:58:18,231
runtime that was the last of the

37702
23:58:15,960 --> 23:58:20,120
algorithms we solve for sorting and in 1

37703
23:58:18,232 --> 23:58:22,720
second we'll see that the correct answer

37704
23:58:20,120 --> 23:58:29,192
is is just edging out everyone else

37705
23:58:22,720 --> 23:58:31,192
indeed 46% it is n I know it's n log now

37706
23:58:29,192 --> 23:58:33,231
if I may as the teacher it can't be

37707
23:58:31,192 --> 23:58:35,480
login because login is strictly less

37708
23:58:33,232 --> 23:58:37,400
than n and you can't possibly sort n

37709
23:58:35,480 --> 23:58:39,231
elements unless you minimally look at or

37710
23:58:37,400 --> 23:58:41,480
touch each of them so it's got to be at

37711
23:58:39,232 --> 23:58:42,760
least greater than n intuitively we

37712
23:58:41,480 --> 23:58:46,120
still have a whole bunch of ties let's

37713
23:58:42,760 --> 23:58:47,511
move on to number four what is stored in

37714
23:58:46,120 --> 23:58:50,080
ARG

37715
23:58:47,512 --> 23:58:52,000
C back to the language C is it in Array

37716
23:58:50,080 --> 23:58:53,720
of arguments the maximum size of an

37717
23:58:52,000 --> 23:58:56,000
array the count of arguments given to a

37718
23:58:53,720 --> 23:58:58,232
program when first run or how much

37719
23:58:56,000 --> 23:59:01,440
memory is allocated to a

37720
23:58:58,232 --> 23:59:05,800
function again you wrote all of these

37721
23:59:01,440 --> 23:59:08,800
questions and we have 5 seconds for the

37722
23:59:05,800 --> 23:59:11,640
reveal ARG C

37723
23:59:08,800 --> 23:59:13,400
is indeed the count of arguments given

37724
23:59:11,640 --> 23:59:15,160
to a program when first run think back

37725
23:59:13,400 --> 23:59:18,480
to C when we did command line arguments

37726
23:59:15,160 --> 23:59:21,080
there was argc and arv argv was the

37727
23:59:18,480 --> 23:59:23,872
array but Arc was indeed the count the

37728
23:59:21,080 --> 23:59:26,600
CN AR save all right we still have a

37729
23:59:23,872 --> 23:59:29,320
whole bunch of ties at the top here but

37730
23:59:26,600 --> 23:59:32,192
let's move on then to number five what

37731
23:59:29,320 --> 23:59:34,160
is the duck debugger favorite hobby

37732
23:59:32,192 --> 23:59:36,280
according to one of your classmates

37733
23:59:34,160 --> 23:59:38,280
dressing up like Dracula swimming across

37734
23:59:36,280 --> 23:59:43,192
the stage filling up the entire bathroom

37735
23:59:38,280 --> 23:59:45,440
of a guy's house and sitting quietly on

37736
23:59:43,192 --> 23:59:46,599
stage the third of course is a reference

37737
23:59:45,440 --> 23:59:49,440
to a YouTube video that was on the

37738
23:59:46,600 --> 23:59:53,832
course's website that week but according

37739
23:59:49,440 --> 23:59:56,280
to your class mate number two seconds

37740
23:59:53,832 --> 23:59:59,552
remaining sitting quietly on stage is

37741
23:59:56,280 --> 24:00:01,280
its favorite pastime so a little harder

37742
23:59:59,552 --> 24:00:04,159
perhaps than the

37743
24:00:01,280 --> 24:00:07,160
others 5,000 now we're starting to see

37744
24:00:04,160 --> 24:00:09,120
some spread so we only have six six

37745
24:00:07,160 --> 24:00:11,960
guests in contention for first place and

37746
24:00:09,120 --> 24:00:14,640
the next question now is six what is the

37747
24:00:11,960 --> 24:00:19,160
function used to open a file in

37748
24:00:14,640 --> 24:00:21,280
C F open open file open

37749
24:00:19,160 --> 24:00:23,680
file

37750
24:00:21,280 --> 24:00:26,080
what is the function used to open a file

37751
24:00:23,680 --> 24:00:26,079
in

37752
24:00:27,192 --> 24:00:32,400
C 7

37753
24:00:29,912 --> 24:00:36,680
Seconds there's some differences between

37754
24:00:32,400 --> 24:00:40,400
C and python here and the reveal it is

37755
24:00:36,680 --> 24:00:42,231
indeed fop it's 77% correct too all

37756
24:00:40,400 --> 24:00:47,871
right let's see the rankings now if you

37757
24:00:42,232 --> 24:00:50,400
are guest 15 9715 6171 3753 or 3273

37758
24:00:47,872 --> 24:00:53,320
you're now in the lead as we move on on

37759
24:00:50,400 --> 24:00:55,280
to se question seven how does Sterling

37760
24:00:53,320 --> 24:00:57,080
compute the average sorry how does

37761
24:00:55,280 --> 24:00:59,800
Sterling compute the length of a string

37762
24:00:57,080 --> 24:01:01,320
in C it looks at how much memory the

37763
24:00:59,800 --> 24:01:03,440
string uses it counts the number of

37764
24:01:01,320 --> 24:01:05,192
characters until it reaches back0 it

37765
24:01:03,440 --> 24:01:06,872
counts the number of bits in the string

37766
24:01:05,192 --> 24:01:08,552
or it creates pointers for each

37767
24:01:06,872 --> 24:01:13,552
character and counts

37768
24:01:08,552 --> 24:01:16,040
them 10 seconds Sterling in

37769
24:01:13,552 --> 24:01:18,400
C recall that we implemented this

37770
24:01:16,040 --> 24:01:20,959
ourselves in class but then we used the

37771
24:01:18,400 --> 24:01:23,280
library thereafter and in indeed with

37772
24:01:20,960 --> 24:01:24,640
85% it simply counts the number of

37773
24:01:23,280 --> 24:01:28,040
characters until it reaches that

37774
24:01:24,640 --> 24:01:30,600
Sentinel back sl0 AKA null and in this

37775
24:01:28,040 --> 24:01:34,439
case we

37776
24:01:30,600 --> 24:01:36,872
have five four four of you tied now for

37777
24:01:34,440 --> 24:01:39,552
first all right question eight where

37778
24:01:36,872 --> 24:01:43,000
does Malo allocate memory

37779
24:01:39,552 --> 24:01:44,040
from the stack the Heap the pointers or

37780
24:01:43,000 --> 24:01:49,080
the

37781
24:01:44,040 --> 24:01:53,799
temp where does malok allocate memory

37782
24:01:49,080 --> 24:01:53,800
from responses are coming in 8

37783
24:01:54,760 --> 24:01:59,760
seconds a good review question at that

37784
24:01:58,160 --> 24:02:02,512
in two seconds we'll see that malok

37785
24:01:59,760 --> 24:02:05,439
allocates memory from woo close one the

37786
24:02:02,512 --> 24:02:07,720
Heap is correct the Heap is correct the

37787
24:02:05,440 --> 24:02:08,912
stack recall is where functions store

37788
24:02:07,720 --> 24:02:10,080
their local variables and their

37789
24:02:08,912 --> 24:02:12,280
arguments and that just happens

37790
24:02:10,080 --> 24:02:14,800
automatically the Heap represented in

37791
24:02:12,280 --> 24:02:18,160
our pictures up top is where malok draws

37792
24:02:14,800 --> 24:02:20,832
from now we have guest

37793
24:02:18,160 --> 24:02:23,512
15 has

37794
24:02:20,832 --> 24:02:25,400
made its way to the top here but others

37795
24:02:23,512 --> 24:02:27,720
can catch up if they don't buzz in fast

37796
24:02:25,400 --> 24:02:30,159
enough so number nine how many people

37797
24:02:27,720 --> 24:02:32,360
flew from 50v to New York on the day of

37798
24:02:30,160 --> 24:02:38,832
the

37799
24:02:32,360 --> 24:02:38,832
crime 16 29 8 or

37800
24:02:39,832 --> 24:02:45,192
three anyone with a laptop perhaps has

37801
24:02:42,440 --> 24:02:45,192
an advantage

37802
24:02:47,280 --> 24:02:57,360
here 5 Seconds

37803
24:02:51,552 --> 24:03:00,760
and the answers are but the answer is

37804
24:02:57,360 --> 24:03:05,192
16 let's see if guest 15 got

37805
24:03:00,760 --> 24:03:07,159
this they did not goodbye to guest 15 at

37806
24:03:05,192 --> 24:03:10,040
the top all right question 10 we're

37807
24:03:07,160 --> 24:03:11,912
about halfway there what are meta tags

37808
24:03:10,040 --> 24:03:15,040
used for in

37809
24:03:11,912 --> 24:03:16,599
HTML to describe a web page to Define

37810
24:03:15,040 --> 24:03:18,552
parameters for an element to group

37811
24:03:16,600 --> 24:03:20,680
elements together to translate content

37812
24:03:18,552 --> 24:03:24,512
into machine readable format

37813
24:03:20,680 --> 24:03:27,079
at what are meta tags used for in HTML

37814
24:03:24,512 --> 24:03:31,000
we saw a few of

37815
24:03:27,080 --> 24:03:34,480
them for different use

37816
24:03:31,000 --> 24:03:36,400
cases and with one second we see that

37817
24:03:34,480 --> 24:03:38,400
indeed the number one answer was to

37818
24:03:36,400 --> 24:03:41,079
describe the web page be it for a mobile

37819
24:03:38,400 --> 24:03:42,799
device be it for screen scrapers like

37820
24:03:41,080 --> 24:03:44,680
Facebook and Twitter and other such apps

37821
24:03:42,800 --> 24:03:46,640
that grab images and descriptions

37822
24:03:44,680 --> 24:03:51,079
thereof all right we're in the second

37823
24:03:46,640 --> 24:03:54,040
half now guest nine guest four 669 has

37824
24:03:51,080 --> 24:03:56,080
edged ahead guess 15 is now in sixth

37825
24:03:54,040 --> 24:03:59,319
place all right number 11 is how do you

37826
24:03:56,080 --> 24:04:02,360
find the address of a variable in C

37827
24:03:59,320 --> 24:04:05,400
think back a few weeks star dollar sign

37828
24:04:02,360 --> 24:04:05,400
Ampersand or

37829
24:04:08,000 --> 24:04:14,832
ask from one of your own classmates how

37830
24:04:10,912 --> 24:04:14,832
do you find the address of a variable in

37831
24:04:18,192 --> 24:04:23,760
C and the number one answer is ersan

37832
24:04:22,080 --> 24:04:26,600
which is indeed the address of operator

37833
24:04:23,760 --> 24:04:30,040
at 62% nicely done let's see who's the

37834
24:04:26,600 --> 24:04:32,760
top of the list now guess 4669 has

37835
24:04:30,040 --> 24:04:36,719
retained their lead so we move on to 12

37836
24:04:32,760 --> 24:04:39,552
what does the arrow operator mean in C a

37837
24:04:36,720 --> 24:04:42,000
hyphen and a greater than sign nothing

37838
24:04:39,552 --> 24:04:44,912
starts a comment replaces a star and Dot

37839
24:04:42,000 --> 24:04:47,440
operator declares a

37840
24:04:44,912 --> 24:04:48,800
pointer what does this Arrow operator

37841
24:04:47,440 --> 24:04:51,000
mean in

37842
24:04:48,800 --> 24:04:55,480
C

37843
24:04:51,000 --> 24:04:59,680
again from a few weeks back 3 seconds

37844
24:04:55,480 --> 24:05:02,080
harder assortment perhaps and it's oh

37845
24:04:59,680 --> 24:05:04,599
replaces a star and Dot operator the

37846
24:05:02,080 --> 24:05:06,800
number two answer was indeed correct

37847
24:05:04,600 --> 24:05:08,600
this was just a cleaner way syntactic

37848
24:05:06,800 --> 24:05:10,232
sugar for collapsing what would be a

37849
24:05:08,600 --> 24:05:12,000
star and then some parentheses and then

37850
24:05:10,232 --> 24:05:13,760
a DOT into quite simply something that

37851
24:05:12,000 --> 24:05:16,872
looks like an arrow itself all right

37852
24:05:13,760 --> 24:05:20,280
Carter who's in the lead now still that

37853
24:05:16,872 --> 24:05:22,400
same guest and let's see what 13 has for

37854
24:05:20,280 --> 24:05:29,360
us which of these is not a data type in

37855
24:05:22,400 --> 24:05:29,360
SQL light blob string integer

37856
24:05:31,120 --> 24:05:36,120
text we used a few of these more

37857
24:05:34,232 --> 24:05:38,280
commonly than others but not all of

37858
24:05:36,120 --> 24:05:42,319
these are for

37859
24:05:38,280 --> 24:05:46,600
real 5 Seconds to make your

37860
24:05:42,320 --> 24:05:49,480
decision and the results are blob is a

37861
24:05:46,600 --> 24:05:53,232
thing string is not in SQL light it's of

37862
24:05:49,480 --> 24:05:55,400
course called text as we've seen it blob

37863
24:05:53,232 --> 24:05:57,600
as goofy as it sounds is just binary

37864
24:05:55,400 --> 24:05:59,319
large object but indeed it's how you

37865
24:05:57,600 --> 24:06:03,080
might store a binary file in your

37866
24:05:59,320 --> 24:06:06,760
database all right the rankings now oh

37867
24:06:03,080 --> 24:06:09,720
guest 8444 has Eed ahead so we move on

37868
24:06:06,760 --> 24:06:11,511
to 14 which of the following is a valid

37869
24:06:09,720 --> 24:06:12,960
way to print Exclamation point

37870
24:06:11,512 --> 24:06:15,872
Exclamation point Exclamation point

37871
24:06:12,960 --> 24:06:18,640
Exclamation point in

37872
24:06:15,872 --> 24:06:20,160
Python I'll let you read these

37873
24:06:18,640 --> 24:06:22,120
yourselves

37874
24:06:20,160 --> 24:06:26,232
which is a valid

37875
24:06:22,120 --> 24:06:26,231
way everyone got quiet in is

37876
24:06:27,000 --> 24:06:34,640
thinking all right 6 seconds few hundred

37877
24:06:31,640 --> 24:06:38,960
responses in so

37878
24:06:34,640 --> 24:06:40,800
far all right and yes nicely done 78% is

37879
24:06:38,960 --> 24:06:42,480
correct you can use the star operator to

37880
24:06:40,800 --> 24:06:45,040
essentially multiply the character at

37881
24:06:42,480 --> 24:06:47,599
left all right who's in the lead Carter

37882
24:06:45,040 --> 24:06:51,079
we now have still G guest

37883
24:06:47,600 --> 24:06:54,600
8444 and so we move on now to 15 what

37884
24:06:51,080 --> 24:06:56,400
does the free function do D allocates

37885
24:06:54,600 --> 24:06:58,640
memory from A Primitive deallocates

37886
24:06:56,400 --> 24:07:00,640
memory at the given pointer terminates a

37887
24:06:58,640 --> 24:07:04,960
loop or returns a value from the

37888
24:07:00,640 --> 24:07:04,960
function what does the free function

37889
24:07:07,400 --> 24:07:12,912
do all right 5 Seconds what does the

37890
24:07:10,960 --> 24:07:15,640
free function do call it's the opposite

37891
24:07:12,912 --> 24:07:18,232
essentially of malok and it deallocates

37892
24:07:15,640 --> 24:07:20,760
the memory at the given pointer as well

37893
24:07:18,232 --> 24:07:22,800
and in C that's on you in Python you

37894
24:07:20,760 --> 24:07:26,120
don't need to worry about allocating or

37895
24:07:22,800 --> 24:07:29,440
freeing aik all right we now have at the

37896
24:07:26,120 --> 24:07:34,080
top still guest 8444 and seeing more and

37897
24:07:29,440 --> 24:07:38,000
more spread 16 which is not a step of

37898
24:07:34,080 --> 24:07:40,552
compiling think back now to week two

37899
24:07:38,000 --> 24:07:44,872
compiling pre-processing linking or

37900
24:07:40,552 --> 24:07:47,640
threading which is not a step of

37901
24:07:44,872 --> 24:07:51,512
compiling we use it as a catchall but it

37902
24:07:47,640 --> 24:07:51,512
technically means a few different things

37903
24:07:54,400 --> 24:07:59,319
collectively all right and threading is

37904
24:07:57,512 --> 24:08:01,960
indeed not on the list that is a

37905
24:07:59,320 --> 24:08:03,872
technical thing generally meaning a

37906
24:08:01,960 --> 24:08:05,960
program can do multiple things at once

37907
24:08:03,872 --> 24:08:09,160
but that is not related here to

37908
24:08:05,960 --> 24:08:11,280
compiling all right guest 8444 is still

37909
24:08:09,160 --> 24:08:14,480
at the top we have just a few questions

37910
24:08:11,280 --> 24:08:16,720
left and so 17 what was the surprise at

37911
24:08:14,480 --> 24:08:18,440
the beginning of the Halloween lecture

37912
24:08:16,720 --> 24:08:21,000
according to your classmates someone

37913
24:08:18,440 --> 24:08:23,440
scared me someone hid candy under every

37914
24:08:21,000 --> 24:08:26,912
chair someone dressed up as me the

37915
24:08:23,440 --> 24:08:26,912
entire staff dressed up as

37916
24:08:28,480 --> 24:08:34,552
Carter interesting litmus test of who

37917
24:08:31,440 --> 24:08:37,512
came to or watch lecture

37918
24:08:34,552 --> 24:08:40,512
perhaps let's see which guests got this

37919
24:08:37,512 --> 24:08:43,280
correct someone someone's really dressed

37920
24:08:40,512 --> 24:08:45,232
up as indeed me at 64% so I think we

37921
24:08:43,280 --> 24:08:47,120
have attendance here essentially from

37922
24:08:45,232 --> 24:08:49,040
that lecture so let's move on now to the

37923
24:08:47,120 --> 24:08:52,360
final few questions after seeing that

37924
24:08:49,040 --> 24:08:54,599
guest a 8444 8444 is still doing well

37925
24:08:52,360 --> 24:08:56,480
can anyone Dethrone them why is it

37926
24:08:54,600 --> 24:08:59,600
incorrect to use the equals equals

37927
24:08:56,480 --> 24:09:02,192
operator in C to compare

37928
24:08:59,600 --> 24:09:03,640
strings it's computationally inefficient

37929
24:09:02,192 --> 24:09:06,192
you comparing the locations of the

37930
24:09:03,640 --> 24:09:09,760
strings strings don't exist using equal

37931
24:09:06,192 --> 24:09:09,760
equals will lead to buffer

37932
24:09:11,400 --> 24:09:16,552
overflow why is it incorrect to use

37933
24:09:13,600 --> 24:09:18,512
equal equals in C to compare strings 3

37934
24:09:16,552 --> 24:09:20,760
seconds we saw this live and it

37935
24:09:18,512 --> 24:09:22,760
motivated like an entire week because

37936
24:09:20,760 --> 24:09:25,280
you're comparing the locations that is

37937
24:09:22,760 --> 24:09:27,080
the addresses in memory of those same

37938
24:09:25,280 --> 24:09:30,192
strings all right let's see if this

37939
24:09:27,080 --> 24:09:32,360
leaves the rankings the same guest 8444

37940
24:09:30,192 --> 24:09:35,080
is still at the top and pulling ahead

37941
24:09:32,360 --> 24:09:39,680
two final questions 19 what is the

37942
24:09:35,080 --> 24:09:42,480
difference between null one L and null 2

37943
24:09:39,680 --> 24:09:45,120
L's they null and null mean the same

37944
24:09:42,480 --> 24:09:47,552
thing nulls refers to back sl0 whereas

37945
24:09:45,120 --> 24:09:49,599
null to L's is the zero address null is

37946
24:09:47,552 --> 24:09:54,400
the zero address whereas null to L's

37947
24:09:49,600 --> 24:09:56,360
refers to back sl0 null is null but

37948
24:09:54,400 --> 24:09:58,871
lazier 5

37949
24:09:56,360 --> 24:10:02,000
Seconds subtle not the best design

37950
24:09:58,872 --> 24:10:05,000
perhaps to have in technical terms but

37951
24:10:02,000 --> 24:10:06,400
indeed 62% of you got that NL is the

37952
24:10:05,000 --> 24:10:09,760
first thing we talked about when we

37953
24:10:06,400 --> 24:10:12,280
talked about back sl0 and N is a pointer

37954
24:10:09,760 --> 24:10:14,439
it's the zero pointer same thing same

37955
24:10:12,280 --> 24:10:18,600
number but different context all right

37956
24:10:14,440 --> 24:10:21,552
Carter guest 8444 is the person to beat

37957
24:10:18,600 --> 24:10:26,280
with our final 20th questions what do

37958
24:10:21,552 --> 24:10:26,280
the binary bulbs on stage spell

37959
24:10:27,600 --> 24:10:33,512
today and these are your four choices

37960
24:10:31,440 --> 24:10:37,760
different from usual we usually use 8

37961
24:10:33,512 --> 24:10:40,080
bit asky today we are using utf8 which

37962
24:10:37,760 --> 24:10:42,871
is a form of Unicode which is the larger

37963
24:10:40,080 --> 24:10:46,512
subset that uses one or two or three or

37964
24:10:42,872 --> 24:10:49,640
even four bites to spell a single

37965
24:10:46,512 --> 24:10:53,600
character and the answer wow close close

37966
24:10:49,640 --> 24:10:55,872
is indeed a cupcake indeed a cupcake

37967
24:10:53,600 --> 24:10:58,872
well done and let's see the final

37968
24:10:55,872 --> 24:11:01,400
results 8444 is the winner are they here

37969
24:10:58,872 --> 24:11:05,410
in person perhaps

37970
24:11:01,400 --> 24:11:08,769
8444 you're 844 come on

37971
24:11:05,410 --> 24:11:08,770
[Applause]

37972
24:11:10,192 --> 24:11:19,480
down thank you here you go

37973
24:11:14,600 --> 24:11:22,552
congratulations oh you're all right so

today if we

37975
24:11:22,552 --> 24:11:26,512
may give me just one

37976
24:11:31,600 --> 24:11:34,912
moment all

37977
24:11:42,320 --> 24:11:48,280
right all right so today we are so

37978
24:11:45,440 --> 24:11:50,720
pleased to be joined by uh Jennifer 8

37979
24:11:48,280 --> 24:11:52,959
Lee who's an of the college a dear

37980
24:11:50,720 --> 24:11:55,640
friend and is actually really the reason

37981
24:11:52,960 --> 24:11:57,480
why there's evidence of Muppets in cs50

37982
24:11:55,640 --> 24:11:59,640
in fact some years ago I was visiting

37983
24:11:57,480 --> 24:12:01,480
her and she had on her shelf like this

37984
24:11:59,640 --> 24:12:03,512
custom Muppet it wasn't one that appears

37985
24:12:01,480 --> 24:12:05,800
on TV but she had somehow gone on a

37986
24:12:03,512 --> 24:12:07,400
website former toy store called FAO

37987
24:12:05,800 --> 24:12:09,040
Schwarz at the time and you're allowed

37988
24:12:07,400 --> 24:12:10,760
to configure your own Muppet whatnot

37989
24:12:09,040 --> 24:12:12,159
choose the eyes the nose the face and

37990
24:12:10,760 --> 24:12:14,120
the Torso and I just thought this was

37991
24:12:12,160 --> 24:12:15,640
the coolest thing and so in the taxi on

37992
24:12:14,120 --> 24:12:17,640
the way home I was like going on the

37993
24:12:15,640 --> 24:12:19,760
website trying to purchase our very

37994
24:12:17,640 --> 24:12:21,600
first Muppet I then woke up the next

37995
24:12:19,760 --> 24:12:23,159
morning thinking why did I just buy a

37996
24:12:21,600 --> 24:12:25,192
puppet in the back of a taxi and so it

37997
24:12:23,160 --> 24:12:26,960
sat on the shelf for really 2 years and

37998
24:12:25,192 --> 24:12:28,720
then a colleague of mine within cs50's

37999
24:12:26,960 --> 24:12:30,400
team decided after I brought it into the

38000
24:12:28,720 --> 24:12:32,192
office to sit on a shelf there to

38001
24:12:30,400 --> 24:12:34,480
actually bring it to life and indeed if

38002
24:12:32,192 --> 24:12:36,599
you Google around cs50 Muppet and

38003
24:12:34,480 --> 24:12:38,280
puppetry online you'll see in fact these

38004
24:12:36,600 --> 24:12:39,832
as characters not only over the past

38005
24:12:38,280 --> 24:12:41,959
couple of years in coid times when

38006
24:12:39,832 --> 24:12:44,000
really there was next to no one actually

38007
24:12:41,960 --> 24:12:46,232
here and so they were instead um but

38008
24:12:44,000 --> 24:12:47,960
indeed she's brought not only this this

38009
24:12:46,232 --> 24:12:50,160
educational element this pedagogical

38010
24:12:47,960 --> 24:12:52,552
element this playful element El to cs50

38011
24:12:50,160 --> 24:12:54,232
and we have her here today to speak to

38012
24:12:52,552 --> 24:12:56,280
exactly the sorts of encodings that are

38013
24:12:54,232 --> 24:12:58,800
here on stage Jenny is the former Vice

38014
24:12:56,280 --> 24:13:01,080
chair of the Unicode subcommittee on

38015
24:12:58,800 --> 24:13:02,832
emoji which is to say that she and her

38016
24:13:01,080 --> 24:13:04,552
colleagues have been influential in

38017
24:13:02,832 --> 24:13:06,552
taking emoji from what was a very

38018
24:13:04,552 --> 24:13:09,720
limited character set early on and by

38019
24:13:06,552 --> 24:13:11,640
far unrepresentative of much uh human

38020
24:13:09,720 --> 24:13:13,832
emotion in speech into really an

38021
24:13:11,640 --> 24:13:16,280
initiative now to capture digitally all

38022
24:13:13,832 --> 24:13:18,360
of the world's languages past present

38023
24:13:16,280 --> 24:13:20,480
and future as well as the range of

38024
24:13:18,360 --> 24:13:22,552
emotions that might see here in the form

38025
24:13:20,480 --> 24:13:24,959
of that pillow or even in the cake that

38026
24:13:22,552 --> 24:13:27,670
awaits so allow me to introduce Jennifer

38027
24:13:24,960 --> 24:13:29,360
8 Lee thank

38028
24:13:27,670 --> 24:13:33,800
[Music]

38029
24:13:29,360 --> 24:13:36,440
you I much drink okay clicker hi all

38030
24:13:33,800 --> 24:13:39,120
right hold on I have to hide my drinks I

38031
24:13:36,440 --> 24:13:41,320
might need more water all right um I'm

38032
24:13:39,120 --> 24:13:44,040
really excited to speak to speak here

38033
24:13:41,320 --> 24:13:45,232
last time last year I was here uh one I

38034
24:13:44,040 --> 24:13:46,760
was wearing a mask which is like a real

38035
24:13:45,232 --> 24:13:49,232
bummer if you're lecturing and then the

38036
24:13:46,760 --> 24:13:51,959
entire like front part was all Muppet so

38037
24:13:49,232 --> 24:13:54,512
I'm really happy to see humans actually

38038
24:13:51,960 --> 24:13:57,080
um and it's always an honor to speak at

38039
24:13:54,512 --> 24:13:58,720
Sanders and and then Dave and I were

38040
24:13:57,080 --> 24:14:00,872
actually classmates way back when so I

38041
24:13:58,720 --> 24:14:03,600
do remember him when he was an undergrad

38042
24:14:00,872 --> 24:14:05,552
much like you so I um I'm going to give

38043
24:14:03,600 --> 24:14:08,160
a talk on the world of emoji and how I

38044
24:14:05,552 --> 24:14:11,872
kind of became an emoji activist so it

38045
24:14:08,160 --> 24:14:14,000
kind of all starts um with my friend e

38046
24:14:11,872 --> 24:14:16,192
inl who is a designer who's well known

38047
24:14:14,000 --> 24:14:18,680
for doing the Twitter fail whale which

38048
24:14:16,192 --> 24:14:21,080
was kind of laid to rest except now this

38049
24:14:18,680 --> 24:14:24,511
week it seems like it may be like may be

38050
24:14:21,080 --> 24:14:26,720
necessary again um so she and I one day

38051
24:14:24,512 --> 24:14:28,872
were texting this is back in 2015 we're

38052
24:14:26,720 --> 24:14:30,872
texting about dumplings because we are

38053
24:14:28,872 --> 24:14:33,120
Chinese is women and we like like to

38054
24:14:30,872 --> 24:14:34,640
text about food and so I sent her this

38055
24:14:33,120 --> 24:14:38,680
picture of dumplings she was like yum

38056
24:14:34,640 --> 24:14:41,360
yum yum yum yum yum yum yum um and then

38057
24:14:38,680 --> 24:14:43,511
she was like oh Apple doesn't have a

38058
24:14:41,360 --> 24:14:44,872
dumpling emoji and I was like oh that's

38059
24:14:43,512 --> 24:14:47,232
kind of interesting and didn't really

38060
24:14:44,872 --> 24:14:48,600
think anything about it because like you

38061
24:14:47,232 --> 24:14:51,192
know people Point things out to you all

38062
24:14:48,600 --> 24:14:52,640
the time and then you just like forget

38063
24:14:51,192 --> 24:14:56,159
you just like move on but then half an

38064
24:14:52,640 --> 24:14:57,800
hour later um on my phone appears this

38065
24:14:56,160 --> 24:14:59,800
like dumpling with hard eyes and you

38066
24:14:57,800 --> 24:15:01,232
don't see it in in because it's a still

38067
24:14:59,800 --> 24:15:02,552
shot but it actually had like blinking

38068
24:15:01,232 --> 24:15:05,040
eyes so she liked to call it like bling

38069
24:15:02,552 --> 24:15:07,512
bling dumpling so she as a designer had

38070
24:15:05,040 --> 24:15:10,120
decided to like go in and like make her

38071
24:15:07,512 --> 24:15:11,512
own dumpling Emoji um because she was

38072
24:15:10,120 --> 24:15:14,159
like I'm a designer I can fix it but

38073
24:15:11,512 --> 24:15:15,872
that actually got me thinking I was like

38074
24:15:14,160 --> 24:15:18,192
where do Emoji come from and like how is

38075
24:15:15,872 --> 24:15:19,912
there not a dumpling Emoji cuz from my

38076
24:15:18,192 --> 24:15:23,680
perspective dumplings are this kind of

38077
24:15:19,912 --> 24:15:27,192
universal food right so and there are a

38078
24:15:23,680 --> 24:15:30,079
lot of Japanese Foods

38079
24:15:27,192 --> 24:15:31,440
on the emoji keyboard and I I was not

38080
24:15:30,080 --> 24:15:34,160
this was like back in 2015 I was like

38081
24:15:31,440 --> 24:15:36,080
not a big Emoji user like at all so I

38082
24:15:34,160 --> 24:15:38,912
mean you have things like Ramen you have

38083
24:15:36,080 --> 24:15:41,232
Bento boxes you have Curry you have

38084
24:15:38,912 --> 24:15:44,760
tempura you even have like kind of

38085
24:15:41,232 --> 24:15:46,400
obscure um kind of foods like this thing

38086
24:15:44,760 --> 24:15:48,511
things on a stick turns out to be fish

38087
24:15:46,400 --> 24:15:51,192
fish things on a stick then this pink

38088
24:15:48,512 --> 24:15:53,080
and white white swirly thing is also a

38089
24:15:51,192 --> 24:15:54,680
fish thing and there's even like that

38090
24:15:53,080 --> 24:15:57,552
triangle rice ball that looks like it's

38091
24:15:54,680 --> 24:16:00,280
had a bikini wax all well represented on

38092
24:15:57,552 --> 24:16:02,080
the Emoji Keyboard but no dumplings and

38093
24:16:00,280 --> 24:16:03,400
it's very strange cuz like all cultures

38094
24:16:02,080 --> 24:16:06,232
kind of have their dumpling right

38095
24:16:03,400 --> 24:16:08,640
whether or not it's um kinali or ravioli

38096
24:16:06,232 --> 24:16:11,440
or aanas like essentially everyone sort

38097
24:16:08,640 --> 24:16:13,680
of like discover the idea of like um

38098
24:16:11,440 --> 24:16:15,680
yummy goodness inside a carbo hydrate

38099
24:16:13,680 --> 24:16:21,231
carbohydrate shell whether not baked or

38100
24:16:15,680 --> 24:16:23,120
fried or um steamed so I was like okay I

38101
24:16:21,232 --> 24:16:25,552
literally Google I was like who controls

38102
24:16:23,120 --> 24:16:27,760
emoji and you discover that they're

38103
24:16:25,552 --> 24:16:31,599
actually regulated by a nonprofit called

38104
24:16:27,760 --> 24:16:33,040
the Unicode Consortium and um it is you

38105
24:16:31,600 --> 24:16:35,080
know and I just like went on their

38106
24:16:33,040 --> 24:16:37,680
website and I discovered that they had

38107
24:16:35,080 --> 24:16:39,440
12 full voting members as of 2015 so

38108
24:16:37,680 --> 24:16:41,159
this is 2015 and they were like mostly

38109
24:16:39,440 --> 24:16:45,280
us multinational tech companies it was

38110
24:16:41,160 --> 24:16:48,232
Oracle it was IBM Microsoft Adobe Google

38111
24:16:45,280 --> 24:16:51,360
Apple Facebook and Yahoo and of the

38112
24:16:48,232 --> 24:16:54,160
three that were not multinational US

38113
24:16:51,360 --> 24:16:56,360
tech companies they were let's see a

38114
24:16:54,160 --> 24:16:58,552
German company called sap a Chinese

38115
24:16:56,360 --> 24:17:00,440
Telecom company called Huawei and then

38116
24:16:58,552 --> 24:17:02,872
like the government of Oman like those

38117
24:17:00,440 --> 24:17:05,280
were basically the 12 full voting

38118
24:17:02,872 --> 24:17:09,552
members of the US multi-national tech

38119
24:17:05,280 --> 24:17:12,192
companies so they at that point paid um

38120
24:17:09,552 --> 24:17:14,760
$118,000 a year to have full voting

38121
24:17:12,192 --> 24:17:16,799
power on the you know Unicode committee

38122
24:17:14,760 --> 24:17:18,871
and I was like oh that's a that's a lot

38123
24:17:16,800 --> 24:17:21,440
of money and I kind of felt indignant

38124
24:17:18,872 --> 24:17:23,080
about this and uh but then like if you

38125
24:17:21,440 --> 24:17:24,552
kind of keep on digging on their website

38126
24:17:23,080 --> 24:17:26,800
you found like there was this kind of

38127
24:17:24,552 --> 24:17:28,680
interesting loophole which is you could

38128
24:17:26,800 --> 24:17:32,000
join as an individual for

38129
24:17:28,680 --> 24:17:34,599
$75 um you don't get voting power but it

38130
24:17:32,000 --> 24:17:36,600
gave you the right to put yourself on

38131
24:17:34,600 --> 24:17:38,400
the email list and also to like attend

38132
24:17:36,600 --> 24:17:39,912
the quarterly Unicode meeting so I was

38133
24:17:38,400 --> 24:17:41,000
like I'll do that I had no idea what I

38134
24:17:39,912 --> 24:17:43,552
was doing but I'm like I'm going to go

38135
24:17:41,000 --> 24:17:45,800
fight um for this dumpling Emoji because

38136
24:17:43,552 --> 24:17:49,800
from my perspective dumplings are

38137
24:17:45,800 --> 24:17:51,280
Universal Emoji are kind of universal so

38138
24:17:49,800 --> 24:17:52,640
uh the fact there was no dumpling Emoji

38139
24:17:51,280 --> 24:17:54,512
meant like something was wrong in the

38140
24:17:52,640 --> 24:17:58,000
universe and I was I was determined to

38141
24:17:54,512 --> 24:17:59,912
fix this so um you know I was on this

38142
24:17:58,000 --> 24:18:01,832
email list and then a couple of like

38143
24:17:59,912 --> 24:18:03,360
maybe even like a couple weeks later I

38144
24:18:01,832 --> 24:18:04,959
got you know they they they kind of sent

38145
24:18:03,360 --> 24:18:07,040
out this note that's like hey who's

38146
24:18:04,960 --> 24:18:09,040
coming to the quarterly meeting and I

38147
24:18:07,040 --> 24:18:10,719
was like um I looked at the calendar I

38148
24:18:09,040 --> 24:18:13,192
looked at my schedule I was like oh I'll

38149
24:18:10,720 --> 24:18:16,280
be in like you know Silicon Valley that

38150
24:18:13,192 --> 24:18:19,120
time so I basically like rsvpd and I was

38151
24:18:16,280 --> 24:18:21,832
like I will be there and took um cow

38152
24:18:19,120 --> 24:18:23,512
train to an Apple building it's a legal

38153
24:18:21,832 --> 24:18:25,480
building in I think it was sunny Veil so

38154
24:18:23,512 --> 24:18:27,280
I just like show up and I don't know

38155
24:18:25,480 --> 24:18:28,912
what I was sort of expecting like with

38156
24:18:27,280 --> 24:18:29,800
like you know the Unicode I think maybe

38157
24:18:28,912 --> 24:18:31,360
thought it was going to be like a baby

38158
24:18:29,800 --> 24:18:33,000
Congress like you know like with a

38159
24:18:31,360 --> 24:18:35,640
little you know very formal seats people

38160
24:18:33,000 --> 24:18:38,080
with gabbles um that is not what I found

38161
24:18:35,640 --> 24:18:40,120
uh basically it is a it was a conference

38162
24:18:38,080 --> 24:18:42,640
room full of people who skewed wider

38163
24:18:40,120 --> 24:18:43,959
skewed older skewed Mal skewed engineers

38164
24:18:42,640 --> 24:18:46,832
and this is basically the room where it

38165
24:18:43,960 --> 24:18:49,872
happen so this is 2015 these were the

38166
24:18:46,832 --> 24:18:52,439
people who decided your Emoji um all

38167
24:18:49,872 --> 24:18:53,760
very nice and um there was you know one

38168
24:18:52,440 --> 24:18:55,680
one even had a daughter who had a sense

38169
24:18:53,760 --> 24:18:59,871
of humor and made him a shirt that said

38170
24:18:55,680 --> 24:19:01,832
shadowy Emoji Overlord um so I just kind

38171
24:18:59,872 --> 24:19:04,480
of listen to them debate things like

38172
24:19:01,832 --> 24:19:06,680
milk emoji and beans emoji and it just

38173
24:19:04,480 --> 24:19:09,280
seemed like not quite right to me that

38174
24:19:06,680 --> 24:19:11,912
like it would be uh This Global visual

38175
24:19:09,280 --> 24:19:13,720
language that were basically decided

38176
24:19:11,912 --> 24:19:15,640
decided by like a a small group of

38177
24:19:13,720 --> 24:19:18,760
people inside a conference room in

38178
24:19:15,640 --> 24:19:20,400
Silicon Valley so I decided to former

38179
24:19:18,760 --> 24:19:22,439
group called Emoji nation whose motto is

38180
24:19:20,400 --> 24:19:24,231
like Emoji by the people for the people

38181
24:19:22,440 --> 24:19:28,000
and it basically advocates for more kind

38182
24:19:24,232 --> 24:19:29,960
of Representative inclusive Emoji um you

38183
24:19:28,000 --> 24:19:32,720
know we we we we start with a

38184
24:19:29,960 --> 24:19:34,000
Kickstarter campaign uh dumpling Emoji

38185
24:19:32,720 --> 24:19:36,960
process trying to like you know write

38186
24:19:34,000 --> 24:19:38,512
the wrong in this world and uh made this

38187
24:19:36,960 --> 24:19:40,000
little cute video sort of advocating

38188
24:19:38,512 --> 24:19:42,400
dink for one of the most universal

38189
24:19:40,000 --> 24:19:46,000
crosscultural Foods in the world Georgia

38190
24:19:42,400 --> 24:19:48,720
has Kali Japan has giosa Korea has Mandu

38191
24:19:46,000 --> 24:19:50,640
Italy has ravioli Poland has barog

38192
24:19:48,720 --> 24:19:53,440
Russia has pelman Argentina has

38193
24:19:50,640 --> 24:19:56,512
empanadas Jewish people have kler China

38194
24:19:53,440 --> 24:19:58,760
has pot stickers Nepal and Tibet have

38195
24:19:56,512 --> 24:20:00,720
Momos yet somehow despite their

38196
24:19:58,760 --> 24:20:03,720
popularity there is no dumpling Emoji in

38197
24:20:00,720 --> 24:20:06,192
the standard set why is that emoji

38198
24:20:03,720 --> 24:20:08,512
exists for pizza tempora Sushi spaghetti

38199
24:20:06,192 --> 24:20:10,959
hot dog and now tacos which Taco Bell

38200
24:20:08,512 --> 24:20:13,960
takes credit for we need to write this

38201
24:20:10,960 --> 24:20:17,360
disparity dumplings are Global Emoji a

38202
24:20:13,960 --> 24:20:18,960
global isn't it time we brought them

38203
24:20:17,360 --> 24:20:20,640
together

38204
24:20:18,960 --> 24:20:23,600
oh yeah and while we're at it how about

38205
24:20:20,640 --> 24:20:23,600
an emoji for Chinese

38206
24:20:24,600 --> 24:20:29,512
takeout so uh I did put together a

38207
24:20:27,640 --> 24:20:31,800
dumpling Emoji proposal I wrote this uh

38208
24:20:29,512 --> 24:20:35,600
I remember Thanksgiving Day 2015 on a

38209
24:20:31,800 --> 24:20:37,760
plane and uh actually and we got it past

38210
24:20:35,600 --> 24:20:40,360
basically dumpling takeout box

38211
24:20:37,760 --> 24:20:42,680
Chopsticks and uh fortune cookie I have

38212
24:20:40,360 --> 24:20:44,080
to say I don't think fortune cookie

38213
24:20:42,680 --> 24:20:46,159
would have made it on its own merits but

38214
24:20:44,080 --> 24:20:48,080
it kind of like slid in on the clo tails

38215
24:20:46,160 --> 24:20:50,640
of the other ones um and so these were

38216
24:20:48,080 --> 24:20:52,832
the proposals as we submitted them and

38217
24:20:50,640 --> 24:20:54,280
then these are the ones that kind of uh

38218
24:20:52,832 --> 24:20:55,912
exist now on the Apple keyboard and I

38219
24:20:54,280 --> 24:20:59,280
have to say the dumpling looks really

38220
24:20:55,912 --> 24:21:00,912
really realistic um oddly realistic and

38221
24:20:59,280 --> 24:21:02,120
whereas like the fortune cookie is think

38222
24:21:00,912 --> 24:21:04,480
it's like a big fail because first of

38223
24:21:02,120 --> 24:21:06,832
all there's like it has no it has no Gap

38224
24:21:04,480 --> 24:21:07,720
it looks like a dead 3D Pac-Man so I'm

38225
24:21:06,832 --> 24:21:10,871
very

38226
24:21:07,720 --> 24:21:13,832
disappointed in uh the manifestation of

38227
24:21:10,872 --> 24:21:15,120
that but that's okay that's okay um and

38228
24:21:13,832 --> 24:21:18,552
so it's kind of interesting like what is

38229
24:21:15,120 --> 24:21:20,871
the process of getting an emoji um ped

38230
24:21:18,552 --> 24:21:22,080
and I will sort of walk you through it

38231
24:21:20,872 --> 24:21:25,400
so first of all you come up with your

38232
24:21:22,080 --> 24:21:27,320
idea right and then you kind of write

38233
24:21:25,400 --> 24:21:29,280
this proposal and then you submit it to

38234
24:21:27,320 --> 24:21:30,640
the Unicode Emoji subcommittee who then

38235
24:21:29,280 --> 24:21:32,160
kind of gives you comments and then

38236
24:21:30,640 --> 24:21:36,280
sends it back to you and you kind of go

38237
24:21:32,160 --> 24:21:38,320
around and around in the circle um and

38238
24:21:36,280 --> 24:21:39,640
when so these are things that we

38239
24:21:38,320 --> 24:21:41,192
consider so somewhere in there I also

38240
24:21:39,640 --> 24:21:43,280
like fought my way on to the Emoji

38241
24:21:41,192 --> 24:21:45,319
committee and then also became a vice

38242
24:21:43,280 --> 24:21:46,680
chair became a vice chair sort of a

38243
24:21:45,320 --> 24:21:49,680
extracurricular that's like completely

38244
24:21:46,680 --> 24:21:52,400
run a muck in my life um um so things

38245
24:21:49,680 --> 24:21:55,640
that matter uh popular demand is a

38246
24:21:52,400 --> 24:21:58,192
frequently requested Emoji um multiple

38247
24:21:55,640 --> 24:21:59,640
usages usages and meaning so that's

38248
24:21:58,192 --> 24:22:01,640
actually kind of very important for

38249
24:21:59,640 --> 24:22:05,400
something like you know certain animals

38250
24:22:01,640 --> 24:22:07,960
have meaning so we did you know sloth a

38251
24:22:05,400 --> 24:22:10,511
while ago and that also has not only the

38252
24:22:07,960 --> 24:22:13,040
literal meaning but sort of like um like

38253
24:22:10,512 --> 24:22:15,600
um connotations there are visually

38254
24:22:13,040 --> 24:22:17,799
distinctiveness it can be recognized so

38255
24:22:15,600 --> 24:22:20,080
this was a blocker for one of the uh

38256
24:22:17,800 --> 24:22:21,800
emojis that I have worked on before

38257
24:22:20,080 --> 24:22:24,160
which is cave which is kind of hard to

38258
24:22:21,800 --> 24:22:25,480
do I think you know meaning wise is

38259
24:22:24,160 --> 24:22:28,080
pretty good but it's really hard to get

38260
24:22:25,480 --> 24:22:30,400
a cave down in emoji sizes and then it

38261
24:22:28,080 --> 24:22:32,160
filling a gap completeness so a good

38262
24:22:30,400 --> 24:22:34,640
example for that is like for some reason

38263
24:22:32,160 --> 24:22:36,320
for many years we had Red Heart yellow

38264
24:22:34,640 --> 24:22:39,872
heart green heart blue heart purple

38265
24:22:36,320 --> 24:22:41,552
heart and uh no orange heart so so

38266
24:22:39,872 --> 24:22:43,120
somewhat so you know you would do the

38267
24:22:41,552 --> 24:22:44,872
rainbow but people would substitute the

38268
24:22:43,120 --> 24:22:46,192
pumpkin in so You' like you know have a

38269
24:22:44,872 --> 24:22:48,640
have a rainbow heart thing with a little

38270
24:22:46,192 --> 24:22:51,080
pumpkin stuck in the middle so orange

38271
24:22:48,640 --> 24:22:53,512
heart obviously should be added and give

38272
24:22:51,080 --> 24:22:55,192
a sense of completeness um and then

38273
24:22:53,512 --> 24:22:57,552
something else is existing vendor cap

38274
24:22:55,192 --> 24:23:01,871
cap compatibility and so a good example

38275
24:22:57,552 --> 24:23:04,400
for that was um many years ago what's

38276
24:23:01,872 --> 24:23:06,720
app decided to uh add the gender

38277
24:23:04,400 --> 24:23:08,799
non-binary emoji and then once it did

38278
24:23:06,720 --> 24:23:12,680
that then all the other kind of vendors

38279
24:23:08,800 --> 24:23:16,512
um jumped on um so what kind of knocks

38280
24:23:12,680 --> 24:23:19,040
out an emoji so too specific or narrow

38281
24:23:16,512 --> 24:23:21,000
so we'll often see that with like very

38282
24:23:19,040 --> 24:23:23,280
specific animals or a very specific

38283
24:23:21,000 --> 24:23:25,960
group it's redundant so one

38284
24:23:23,280 --> 24:23:27,800
year oh my God who makes that Butterball

38285
24:23:25,960 --> 24:23:30,832
Butterball makes the turkeys Butterball

38286
24:23:27,800 --> 24:23:32,680
submitted um a an emoji proposal that

38287
24:23:30,832 --> 24:23:34,280
was like a cooked turkey but we already

38288
24:23:32,680 --> 24:23:35,719
had a live turkey so it seem kind of

38289
24:23:34,280 --> 24:23:38,720
redundant have both like a cooked turkey

38290
24:23:35,720 --> 24:23:41,440
for Thanksgiving and a live turkey so so

38291
24:23:38,720 --> 24:23:42,912
not visually discernible um this is a

38292
24:23:41,440 --> 24:23:46,680
struggle for things like I don't my

38293
24:23:42,912 --> 24:23:49,040
friends have kind of proposed

38294
24:23:46,680 --> 24:23:51,760
kimchi kimchi is is really hard on emoji

38295
24:23:49,040 --> 24:23:53,000
sizes for many reasons and part of that

38296
24:23:51,760 --> 24:23:54,799
but part of that tension is because it's

38297
24:23:53,000 --> 24:23:57,080
not visually discernable then there are

38298
24:23:54,800 --> 24:24:00,280
no logos Brands deities or celebrities

38299
24:23:57,080 --> 24:24:01,760
so no Nike swish no McDonald's M and

38300
24:24:00,280 --> 24:24:04,040
then this is one that we kind of decided

38301
24:24:01,760 --> 24:24:06,000
in the last uh year or so which is no

38302
24:24:04,040 --> 24:24:09,079
more flags flags are a very complicated

38303
24:24:06,000 --> 24:24:10,360
thing um and as a result Unico does not

38304
24:24:09,080 --> 24:24:12,912
want to be in the business of deciding

38305
24:24:10,360 --> 24:24:13,960
what is a country or not a country uh so

38306
24:24:12,912 --> 24:24:16,800
like you know when you get a proposal

38307
24:24:13,960 --> 24:24:18,600
from like Kurdistan you're like yeah so

38308
24:24:16,800 --> 24:24:20,360
right now the way that the Emoji flags

38309
24:24:18,600 --> 24:24:22,872
are decided is they kind of depend on

38310
24:24:20,360 --> 24:24:24,080
what the UN recognizes and then those

38311
24:24:22,872 --> 24:24:25,832
get passed down to the international

38312
24:24:24,080 --> 24:24:27,800
standards organization and then and then

38313
24:24:25,832 --> 24:24:29,680
Uno just does that like it does not want

38314
24:24:27,800 --> 24:24:31,912
to be in the business of kind of you

38315
24:24:29,680 --> 24:24:34,912
know geopolitical

38316
24:24:31,912 --> 24:24:37,512
Affairs um so once it comes out of the

38317
24:24:34,912 --> 24:24:39,192
subcommittee it goes to the full Unicode

38318
24:24:37,512 --> 24:24:40,320
technical committee UTC those were the

38319
24:24:39,192 --> 24:24:45,159
people that were in the room that I

38320
24:24:40,320 --> 24:24:48,080
showed you um and they vote once a year

38321
24:24:45,160 --> 24:24:49,400
basically to pass all the Emoji and

38322
24:24:48,080 --> 24:24:50,680
takes a while there's a lot of like

38323
24:24:49,400 --> 24:24:53,720
coordinating with the international

38324
24:24:50,680 --> 24:24:54,912
standards organization and like a lot of

38325
24:24:53,720 --> 24:24:56,552
working with the companies and

38326
24:24:54,912 --> 24:24:59,040
eventually it takes a long time but it

38327
24:24:56,552 --> 24:25:00,832
ends up on your on your devices and that

38328
24:24:59,040 --> 24:25:02,280
historically is taken about 18 to 24

38329
24:25:00,832 --> 24:25:03,640
months from when you put in the propose

38330
24:25:02,280 --> 24:25:06,080
to when you get it in it's going to be a

38331
24:25:03,640 --> 24:25:09,319
little bit longer um going forward

38332
24:25:06,080 --> 24:25:11,192
probably is my sense as we were're going

38333
24:25:09,320 --> 24:25:14,320
to Unicode has decided to sort of space

38334
24:25:11,192 --> 24:25:16,871
out some of the Unicode releases so yeah

38335
24:25:14,320 --> 24:25:18,800
Emoji Nation you know kind of has done

38336
24:25:16,872 --> 24:25:20,640
its thing so of the weird things is like

38337
24:25:18,800 --> 24:25:22,400
how did Unicode this like kind of

38338
24:25:20,640 --> 24:25:24,192
nonprofit organization based in Mountain

38339
24:25:22,400 --> 24:25:27,511
View California end up controlling this

38340
24:25:24,192 --> 24:25:29,680
like Global visual language um so a lot

38341
24:25:27,512 --> 24:25:31,120
of it has to start with has has to do

38342
24:25:29,680 --> 24:25:33,871
with the fact that emoji started in

38343
24:25:31,120 --> 24:25:38,192
Japan uh back in the late 1990s one of

38344
24:25:33,872 --> 24:25:39,440
the this set from dok 1999 is considered

38345
24:25:38,192 --> 24:25:41,512
is widely considered sort of like the

38346
24:25:39,440 --> 24:25:44,320
first like color Emoji set it has been

38347
24:25:41,512 --> 24:25:46,760
collected by the Museum of Modern Art

38348
24:25:44,320 --> 24:25:48,600
and um so these the Japanese telecom

38349
24:25:46,760 --> 24:25:50,439
companies would use

38350
24:25:48,600 --> 24:25:52,120
basically would have their own sets of

38351
24:25:50,440 --> 24:25:53,512
emoji and then they were different

38352
24:25:52,120 --> 24:25:55,192
companies so they would have different

38353
24:25:53,512 --> 24:25:56,832
sets so you could basically only send

38354
24:25:55,192 --> 24:25:59,040
these like visual characters with

38355
24:25:56,832 --> 24:26:01,159
someone who is on your same carrier so

38356
24:25:59,040 --> 24:26:02,799
it's like it's like basically equivalent

38357
24:26:01,160 --> 24:26:05,080
of if you were on like Verizon you can

38358
24:26:02,800 --> 24:26:07,600
only text people on Verizon with like

38359
24:26:05,080 --> 24:26:10,760
Emoji or if you were on um T-Mobile you

38360
24:26:07,600 --> 24:26:14,760
could only do that so at a certain point

38361
24:26:10,760 --> 24:26:16,511
they um decided they were they the Apple

38362
24:26:14,760 --> 24:26:18,400
and Google came into Japan they wanted

38363
24:26:16,512 --> 24:26:21,280
to start selling smartphones and they

38364
24:26:18,400 --> 24:26:23,912
realized that it was a hodgepodge of

38365
24:26:21,280 --> 24:26:26,720
systems and they wanted to unify it and

38366
24:26:23,912 --> 24:26:29,280
so in 2007 they went to unic code and

38367
24:26:26,720 --> 24:26:33,232
they're like okay help us unify the

38368
24:26:29,280 --> 24:26:34,959
Emoji um like kind of like basically all

38369
24:26:33,232 --> 24:26:37,912
the Emojis so that we have one standard

38370
24:26:34,960 --> 24:26:39,600
system and part of the reason is why

38371
24:26:37,912 --> 24:26:41,440
Unicode because Unicode basically has

38372
24:26:39,600 --> 24:26:43,120
this mission is to enable everyone

38373
24:26:41,440 --> 24:26:44,912
speaking every language on Earth to be

38374
24:26:43,120 --> 24:26:47,480
able to use your languages on computer

38375
24:26:44,912 --> 24:26:50,080
and smartphone so it basically unifies

38376
24:26:47,480 --> 24:26:52,280
um all written languages into one

38377
24:26:50,080 --> 24:26:54,872
ginormous set and that was not the case

38378
24:26:52,280 --> 24:26:56,912
actually when I was uh growing up there

38379
24:26:54,872 --> 24:26:58,120
was a point where like if you you were

38380
24:26:56,912 --> 24:27:00,800
Japanese on Apple that would be

38381
24:26:58,120 --> 24:27:03,192
different than Japanese on um dos or

38382
24:27:00,800 --> 24:27:04,760
like Chinese or Arabic so it drove

38383
24:27:03,192 --> 24:27:07,832
everyone crazy and they basically

38384
24:27:04,760 --> 24:27:09,760
decided um around the late 80s early

38385
24:27:07,832 --> 24:27:11,319
1990s that they were going to come up

38386
24:27:09,760 --> 24:27:15,439
with one standardized system that sort

38387
24:27:11,320 --> 24:27:18,640
of encoded all characters in in one

38388
24:27:15,440 --> 24:27:20,232
ginormous set so um there's three main

38389
24:27:18,640 --> 24:27:22,480
projects for Unicode if you care so one

38390
24:27:20,232 --> 24:27:24,080
is encoding characters including Emoji

38391
24:27:22,480 --> 24:27:27,000
now they're about 100,000 characters

38392
24:27:24,080 --> 24:27:30,680
aside assigned so that includes like

38393
24:27:27,000 --> 24:27:33,760
like Chinese Japanese Korean uh Arabic

38394
24:27:30,680 --> 24:27:36,400
cilic um actually all the hieroglyphics

38395
24:27:33,760 --> 24:27:38,511
all of the Emoji um a lot of things like

38396
24:27:36,400 --> 24:27:40,959
the Bitcoin symbol or like copy left or

38397
24:27:38,512 --> 24:27:43,320
whatever those all assigned were about

38398
24:27:40,960 --> 24:27:45,760
100,000 uh characters even those

38399
24:27:43,320 --> 24:27:48,280
languages that are basically out of use

38400
24:27:45,760 --> 24:27:51,799
so the other thing it does it creates

38401
24:27:48,280 --> 24:27:53,000
um localization resources so things

38402
24:27:51,800 --> 24:27:55,552
things so that you know like oh if

38403
24:27:53,000 --> 24:27:58,000
you're in this country this is this is

38404
24:27:55,552 --> 24:27:59,760
uh you're using the Euro or you're using

38405
24:27:58,000 --> 24:28:02,320
the pesos or something so there's a lot

38406
24:27:59,760 --> 24:28:05,400
of localization that is that data that

38407
24:28:02,320 --> 24:28:07,120
is needed depending on which um

38408
24:28:05,400 --> 24:28:08,871
geography you're using your device from

38409
24:28:07,120 --> 24:28:10,552
or like that you know you you know that

38410
24:28:08,872 --> 24:28:12,640
the time is used this way or the dates

38411
24:28:10,552 --> 24:28:16,040
are shown that way so that is called um

38412
24:28:12,640 --> 24:28:17,440
the common local data repository or cldr

38413
24:28:16,040 --> 24:28:19,280
as they call it and the other thing they

38414
24:28:17,440 --> 24:28:22,440
do is they kind of maintain libraries

38415
24:28:19,280 --> 24:28:23,760
for developers in order to do all um to

38416
24:28:22,440 --> 24:28:25,000
kind of so they are not building

38417
24:28:23,760 --> 24:28:27,552
everything from scratch and that is

38418
24:28:25,000 --> 24:28:30,832
called ICU so it's very funny cuz like

38419
24:28:27,552 --> 24:28:33,720
it's called cldr and then one day one of

38420
24:28:30,832 --> 24:28:37,040
our friends girlfriends made him this

38421
24:28:33,720 --> 24:28:39,232
thing which she called a seal deer

38422
24:28:37,040 --> 24:28:41,912
because whenever he talked about

38423
24:28:39,232 --> 24:28:44,000
cldr he thought he thought she thought

38424
24:28:41,912 --> 24:28:46,120
he was talking about seal deers so now

38425
24:28:44,000 --> 24:28:49,120
this is his little like mascot for like

38426
24:28:46,120 --> 24:28:50,799
Unicode related things so what is um how

38427
24:28:49,120 --> 24:28:53,640
does Unicode do this so it basically

38428
24:28:50,800 --> 24:28:56,000
asss code points and each code point is

38429
24:28:53,640 --> 24:29:00,192
a unique number assigned to each Unicode

38430
24:28:56,000 --> 24:29:02,400
character so uh face with tears of joy

38431
24:29:00,192 --> 24:29:04,400
can be written like this with a code

38432
24:29:02,400 --> 24:29:05,959
point or it can be written like this in

38433
24:29:04,400 --> 24:29:07,360
terms of decimal numbers and it can also

38434
24:29:05,960 --> 24:29:09,800
be written this in binary numbers so

38435
24:29:07,360 --> 24:29:12,040
these are all basically the same and the

38436
24:29:09,800 --> 24:29:13,800
key thing to know at least about Emoji

38437
24:29:12,040 --> 24:29:16,000
is that when your device if you're

38438
24:29:13,800 --> 24:29:18,600
talking your iPhone with um someone

38439
24:29:16,000 --> 24:29:20,320
who's on a laptop or an iPad or like um

38440
24:29:18,600 --> 24:29:22,040
an Android device it's not sending the

38441
24:29:20,320 --> 24:29:24,040
images back and forth it's sending just

38442
24:29:22,040 --> 24:29:27,120
a number back and forth and then locally

38443
24:29:24,040 --> 24:29:29,640
your phone or like your laptop decides

38444
24:29:27,120 --> 24:29:32,231
like oh this number correlates with

38445
24:29:29,640 --> 24:29:34,232
which image um in terms of our emoji

38446
24:29:32,232 --> 24:29:37,872
font and then pulls it up so this is

38447
24:29:34,232 --> 24:29:39,680
really key to know why different Emoji

38448
24:29:37,872 --> 24:29:43,320
look different on different

38449
24:29:39,680 --> 24:29:45,319
platforms so 2007 to 2010 it took about

38450
24:29:43,320 --> 24:29:46,872
three years but Unicode 6.0 came out

38451
24:29:45,320 --> 24:29:49,040
with a first our first little baby set

38452
24:29:46,872 --> 24:29:50,872
of emoji um and it just kind of hung out

38453
24:29:49,040 --> 24:29:53,871
there for a year like no one it wasn't

38454
24:29:50,872 --> 24:29:56,192
doing anything so 2011 though Apple

38455
24:29:53,872 --> 24:29:58,760
starts adding the emoji keyboard and it

38456
24:29:56,192 --> 24:30:01,040
it just like explodes like I feel like

38457
24:29:58,760 --> 24:30:03,159
in some ways Emoji are were not like

38458
24:30:01,040 --> 24:30:05,040
invented they were discovered they like

38459
24:30:03,160 --> 24:30:09,512
obviously touch something very very

38460
24:30:05,040 --> 24:30:11,120
Primal to um to like our human desire to

38461
24:30:09,512 --> 24:30:14,080
like communicate in like little colorful

38462
24:30:11,120 --> 24:30:15,440
glyphs on electronic devices and you

38463
24:30:14,080 --> 24:30:18,600
kind of have what's kind of really

38464
24:30:15,440 --> 24:30:21,232
interesting is like the ambiguity that

38465
24:30:18,600 --> 24:30:22,800
comes with what emoji kind of mean and

38466
24:30:21,232 --> 24:30:24,232
so one of the you know this one my

38467
24:30:22,800 --> 24:30:26,080
favorite emoji is sort of like an upside

38468
24:30:24,232 --> 24:30:27,872
down smiley face very very ambiguous

38469
24:30:26,080 --> 24:30:29,600
clearly very ambiguous because if you

38470
24:30:27,872 --> 24:30:31,192
start typing into Google like the top

38471
24:30:29,600 --> 24:30:32,872
hits are like what does it mean from a

38472
24:30:31,192 --> 24:30:34,440
guy what does it mean from a girl like

38473
24:30:32,872 --> 24:30:36,640
it's clearly something that a lot of

38474
24:30:34,440 --> 24:30:41,080
people are are using in like complex

38475
24:30:36,640 --> 24:30:42,960
situationships between each other so um

38476
24:30:41,080 --> 24:30:45,120
so so one of the fun things is who can

38477
24:30:42,960 --> 24:30:47,760
propose Emoji technically anyone can

38478
24:30:45,120 --> 24:30:49,832
anyone here can normal normal humans can

38479
24:30:47,760 --> 24:30:51,640
we have basically Google doc uh or

38480
24:30:49,832 --> 24:30:54,000
Google form that we throw up uh

38481
24:30:51,640 --> 24:30:57,960
historically between August sorry April

38482
24:30:54,000 --> 24:31:00,280
and August in the last two years um and

38483
24:30:57,960 --> 24:31:02,552
uh so this is one of our my our favorite

38484
24:31:00,280 --> 24:31:04,800
examples this is Ru aumed she was a

38485
24:31:02,552 --> 24:31:06,912
15-year-old Saudi Arabian girl who was

38486
24:31:04,800 --> 24:31:10,600
living in Vienna at the time that she

38487
24:31:06,912 --> 24:31:12,040
proposed the um hijab emoji and then you

38488
24:31:10,600 --> 24:31:13,680
know then she was like Time Magazine

38489
24:31:12,040 --> 24:31:14,640
like you know coolest teens she got like

38490
24:31:13,680 --> 24:31:16,359
a whole bunch of different things she

38491
24:31:14,640 --> 24:31:20,760
got into Harvard and Stanford and she

38492
24:31:16,360 --> 24:31:22,400
went to Stanford um and uh so this is a

38493
24:31:20,760 --> 24:31:24,552
PR we got then there was a group of

38494
24:31:22,400 --> 24:31:26,871
folks from Argentina who got the mate

38495
24:31:24,552 --> 24:31:29,720
Emoji kind of they you know similar

38496
24:31:26,872 --> 24:31:31,760
their national drink then we worked with

38497
24:31:29,720 --> 24:31:36,360
um there was a a nonprofit that really

38498
24:31:31,760 --> 24:31:38,400
wanted to like get a menstruation emoji

38499
24:31:36,360 --> 24:31:40,680
and so what they proposed to begin with

38500
24:31:38,400 --> 24:31:43,480
was like bloody underwear and I was just

38501
24:31:40,680 --> 24:31:46,319
like no no no so many different reasons

38502
24:31:43,480 --> 24:31:47,680
why this is a terrible Emoji uh but so

38503
24:31:46,320 --> 24:31:49,960
we did get blood drops so then you can

38504
24:31:47,680 --> 24:31:51,319
do Moon and blood drop or underwear and

38505
24:31:49,960 --> 24:31:52,800
blood drop there's a lot of different

38506
24:31:51,320 --> 24:31:55,080
ways actually it's really funny cuz I

38507
24:31:52,800 --> 24:31:57,912
was ping my friends beforehand what they

38508
24:31:55,080 --> 24:31:59,480
would use to indicate menstruation

38509
24:31:57,912 --> 24:32:01,872
before there you know there was a blood

38510
24:31:59,480 --> 24:32:05,080
drop so there was like red wine there

38511
24:32:01,872 --> 24:32:07,400
was like kind of that Rose um with the

38512
24:32:05,080 --> 24:32:09,832
like falling petal and then my favorite

38513
24:32:07,400 --> 24:32:11,720
is actually um my friend who used a

38514
24:32:09,832 --> 24:32:13,480
Japanese flag as a way to indicate that

38515
24:32:11,720 --> 24:32:16,280
she was having her

38516
24:32:13,480 --> 24:32:19,480
period so um one of the biggest

38517
24:32:16,280 --> 24:32:22,160
contributors this uh skin tone Emoji

38518
24:32:19,480 --> 24:32:25,480
appeared I think in 2015 it was amazing

38519
24:32:22,160 --> 24:32:27,872
it is and it was proposed by a mom

38520
24:32:25,480 --> 24:32:29,800
Katrina parrot she is a entrepreneur and

38521
24:32:27,872 --> 24:32:32,400
a mom who is just like at home one day

38522
24:32:29,800 --> 24:32:35,080
and her daughter comes home and is

38523
24:32:32,400 --> 24:32:37,680
like you know I wish there were emoji

38524
24:32:35,080 --> 24:32:40,192
that looked like me and her mom was like

38525
24:32:37,680 --> 24:32:43,000
that's great honey what's an emoji and

38526
24:32:40,192 --> 24:32:45,640
so she like me I guess Googled and just

38527
24:32:43,000 --> 24:32:47,000
figured out that uh Unicode controlled

38528
24:32:45,640 --> 24:32:48,872
emoji and she just came up with a

38529
24:32:47,000 --> 24:32:50,512
proposal saying we should not only have

38530
24:32:48,872 --> 24:32:51,872
the yellow you know skin tones at that

38531
24:32:50,512 --> 24:32:55,552
time everything was sort of Simpsons

38532
24:32:51,872 --> 24:32:59,232
yellow um it's really interesting to see

38533
24:32:55,552 --> 24:33:01,400
how race and like nationality are like

38534
24:32:59,232 --> 24:33:04,232
depicted in different parts of the world

38535
24:33:01,400 --> 24:33:07,231
so originally in Japan everyone was

38536
24:33:04,232 --> 24:33:08,512
yellow um but this these were the non

38537
24:33:07,232 --> 24:33:11,192
you know by default everyone was just

38538
24:33:08,512 --> 24:33:12,512
like like you know human or Japanese but

38539
24:33:11,192 --> 24:33:15,360
they had like a couple things that were

38540
24:33:12,512 --> 24:33:17,280
like not like one was you had a blonde

38541
24:33:15,360 --> 24:33:19,040
person so there's an emoji called like

38542
24:33:17,280 --> 24:33:21,192
blonde blonde woman or whatever that

38543
24:33:19,040 --> 24:33:23,079
represents all westerners okay so that

38544
24:33:21,192 --> 24:33:24,680
was one and then they have one that's

38545
24:33:23,080 --> 24:33:25,912
like an Indian guy with a turban so

38546
24:33:24,680 --> 24:33:28,159
that's supposed to represent Indian

38547
24:33:25,912 --> 24:33:30,480
people and then there's like a like a

38548
24:33:28,160 --> 24:33:31,440
guy with a little like um little hat

38549
24:33:30,480 --> 24:33:33,120
that's supposed to represent like

38550
24:33:31,440 --> 24:33:35,040
Chinese people so that was like that was

38551
24:33:33,120 --> 24:33:37,512
the view Japanese view of race which was

38552
24:33:35,040 --> 24:33:39,599
like default then you were I then you

38553
24:33:37,512 --> 24:33:42,600
were like blonde Western Chinese or

38554
24:33:39,600 --> 24:33:44,640
Indian and and that is all there was and

38555
24:33:42,600 --> 24:33:46,720
um obviously in the United States we

38556
24:33:44,640 --> 24:33:48,360
care a lot about race and then so she

38557
24:33:46,720 --> 24:33:51,400
came up with this system with five skin

38558
24:33:48,360 --> 24:33:52,872
tones um like just like normal people

38559
24:33:51,400 --> 24:33:56,319
some guy in Germany decided that he

38560
24:33:52,872 --> 24:33:59,640
wanted to do a a a face with one eyebrow

38561
24:33:56,320 --> 24:34:04,320
raised or as we call it the coar Emoji

38562
24:33:59,640 --> 24:34:06,552
um and oh this one's fun so woman's flat

38563
24:34:04,320 --> 24:34:08,680
shoe I have to say not highly used

38564
24:34:06,552 --> 24:34:09,912
statistically at this point but I really

38565
24:34:08,680 --> 24:34:11,871
kind of appreciate it because it was a

38566
24:34:09,912 --> 24:34:14,760
mom who was very offended that all

38567
24:34:11,872 --> 24:34:16,600
women's shoes had heels even the sandals

38568
24:34:14,760 --> 24:34:18,480
so this is her she had like three kids

38569
24:34:16,600 --> 24:34:25,280
at the time now is four she was very

38570
24:34:18,480 --> 24:34:30,040
fertile um and she also did um the women

38571
24:34:25,280 --> 24:34:32,680
women's flat okay she also did um um one

38572
24:34:30,040 --> 24:34:34,511
piece bathing suit because she was also

38573
24:34:32,680 --> 24:34:35,832
um offended by the fact that the only

38574
24:34:34,512 --> 24:34:38,000
kind of bathing suit you had was like

38575
24:34:35,832 --> 24:34:39,120
this like little itsy-bitsy polka dot

38576
24:34:38,000 --> 24:34:41,232
bikini thing which is not great if

38577
24:34:39,120 --> 24:34:42,599
you're like taking your six-year-old so

38578
24:34:41,232 --> 24:34:44,232
I have to say that got passed but like

38579
24:34:42,600 --> 24:34:46,832
it didn't go over like super well with

38580
24:34:44,232 --> 24:34:48,800
everyone um so you know unic Cod because

38581
24:34:46,832 --> 24:34:51,799
it's very public submits things for

38582
24:34:48,800 --> 24:34:54,232
comments and um we got this comment back

38583
24:34:51,800 --> 24:34:56,192
so one piece bathing suit why a person

38584
24:34:54,232 --> 24:34:58,872
want to indicate the use of swimwear

38585
24:34:56,192 --> 24:35:01,280
can't use existing bikini is this really

38586
24:34:58,872 --> 24:35:03,512
necessary what about a Victorian bathing

38587
24:35:01,280 --> 24:35:06,232
costume or a wet suit or water rings

38588
24:35:03,512 --> 24:35:10,440
this is like literally in in like uh the

38589
24:35:06,232 --> 24:35:11,680
records and like do not encode um and so

38590
24:35:10,440 --> 24:35:13,872
the person who did it's actually very

38591
24:35:11,680 --> 24:35:16,680
impressive he's actually the person who

38592
24:35:13,872 --> 24:35:18,800
created the middle finger emoji and

38593
24:35:16,680 --> 24:35:20,511
actually you ever seen the Vulcan Emoji

38594
24:35:18,800 --> 24:35:23,192
he he the Vulcan hand emoji he's

38595
24:35:20,512 --> 24:35:24,480
actually very active and I have to say

38596
24:35:23,192 --> 24:35:26,400
this is actually I think one of the more

38597
24:35:24,480 --> 24:35:29,120
impressive Emoji so so obviously

38598
24:35:26,400 --> 24:35:30,552
obviously we have a lot of active debate

38599
24:35:29,120 --> 24:35:32,871
um sometimes you get like whole

38600
24:35:30,552 --> 24:35:34,440
countries submitting so literally the

38601
24:35:32,872 --> 24:35:35,760
government of Finland as in like their

38602
24:35:34,440 --> 24:35:38,680
equivalent in the state department their

38603
24:35:35,760 --> 24:35:42,599
diplomacy kind of thing uh submitted a

38604
24:35:38,680 --> 24:35:46,000
proposal for SAA and um these were so

38605
24:35:42,600 --> 24:35:50,080
creepy and so

38606
24:35:46,000 --> 24:35:52,440
weird so much is wrong with this and but

38607
24:35:50,080 --> 24:35:54,360
I I I felt where they were coming from

38608
24:35:52,440 --> 24:35:57,400
first of all like they're naked they

38609
24:35:54,360 --> 24:35:59,440
have no they have club feet and so we

38610
24:35:57,400 --> 24:36:01,000
decided to help them we're like okay we

38611
24:35:59,440 --> 24:36:03,640
see where you're going with this let's

38612
24:36:01,000 --> 24:36:05,280
see if we can like help you like come up

38613
24:36:03,640 --> 24:36:07,000
you know like we had the spoon like

38614
24:36:05,280 --> 24:36:08,440
should there be like steam around them

38615
24:36:07,000 --> 24:36:10,720
like should they be naked or wearing a

38616
24:36:08,440 --> 24:36:11,872
tow towel it's like super like dicey but

38617
24:36:10,720 --> 24:36:13,192
we wanted to help them because it was

38618
24:36:11,872 --> 24:36:15,320
like literally a foreign government

38619
24:36:13,192 --> 24:36:17,192
coming from an Unicode advocating for

38620
24:36:15,320 --> 24:36:19,600
the sauna emoji on behalf of their ENT

38621
24:36:17,192 --> 24:36:21,159
country so then this is um is sort of

38622
24:36:19,600 --> 24:36:23,192
evolved into just basically person in

38623
24:36:21,160 --> 24:36:25,872
stey room which is which is the most

38624
24:36:23,192 --> 24:36:27,599
sort of like the PG version of sauna no

38625
24:36:25,872 --> 24:36:30,000
and there's no spoon they're all dressed

38626
24:36:27,600 --> 24:36:31,912
it's very odd but um so you can see the

38627
24:36:30,000 --> 24:36:34,640
evolution of what it started out what we

38628
24:36:31,912 --> 24:36:36,680
submitted and what it ended up so

38629
24:36:34,640 --> 24:36:39,000
there's a lot of like Evolution

38630
24:36:36,680 --> 24:36:41,359
throughout the entire process um and

38631
24:36:39,000 --> 24:36:43,080
like companies can submit Emoji

38632
24:36:41,360 --> 24:36:44,800
proposals too so Google actually worked

38633
24:36:43,080 --> 24:36:47,080
on this one I love this one okay so just

38634
24:36:44,800 --> 24:36:49,400
to give you some context as of 2015

38635
24:36:47,080 --> 24:36:52,912
there are many ways you could be or have

38636
24:36:49,400 --> 24:36:55,079
an occupation as a male on the Emoji

38637
24:36:52,912 --> 24:36:57,319
Keyboard right like like for example you

38638
24:36:55,080 --> 24:36:59,120
could be a police officer you could be a

38639
24:36:57,320 --> 24:37:01,440
detective you could be a Buckingham

38640
24:36:59,120 --> 24:37:03,159
Palace guard you could even be Santa

38641
24:37:01,440 --> 24:37:04,760
Claus like these are so many jobs that

38642
24:37:03,160 --> 24:37:06,320
you could have but if you were a woman

38643
24:37:04,760 --> 24:37:08,680
as of 2015 there were four things that

38644
24:37:06,320 --> 24:37:11,360
you could be you could be a princess you

38645
24:37:08,680 --> 24:37:12,719
could be a bride you could be a dancer

38646
24:37:11,360 --> 24:37:14,512
or you could be a Playboy Bunny these

38647
24:37:12,720 --> 24:37:18,440
were the sum total of all the

38648
24:37:14,512 --> 24:37:19,800
occupations that we can have so so we

38649
24:37:18,440 --> 24:37:21,320
there was sort of this movement at that

38650
24:37:19,800 --> 24:37:23,360
time there was like this like video on

38651
24:37:21,320 --> 24:37:25,080
YouTube that like went viral there was

38652
24:37:23,360 --> 24:37:27,800
like a New York Times op that was like

38653
24:37:25,080 --> 24:37:29,720
where are the women with professions so

38654
24:37:27,800 --> 24:37:32,360
um basically they came up with a set of

38655
24:37:29,720 --> 24:37:34,080
emoji for professions and what's nice is

38656
24:37:32,360 --> 24:37:36,552
not only did women have these

38657
24:37:34,080 --> 24:37:38,640
professions now men have them too so of

38658
24:37:36,552 --> 24:37:40,872
emoji Nation Emoji these are some of the

38659
24:37:38,640 --> 24:37:42,832
ones that we've worked on I think about

38660
24:37:40,872 --> 24:37:44,872
130 of the Emoji on your keyboard

38661
24:37:42,832 --> 24:37:48,040
probably came through touched our system

38662
24:37:44,872 --> 24:37:50,640
in in some way including I I have to say

38663
24:37:48,040 --> 24:37:52,552
uh microbe or virus I think I have the

38664
24:37:50,640 --> 24:37:54,960
opinion that every Emoji has its day

38665
24:37:52,552 --> 24:37:56,760
right like it might not be like today it

38666
24:37:54,960 --> 24:37:58,320
might not be next year but I have to say

38667
24:37:56,760 --> 24:38:00,000
virus was not doing anything then came

38668
24:37:58,320 --> 24:38:02,400
2020 and that was like such a good

38669
24:38:00,000 --> 24:38:06,400
moment for it um along with soap we had

38670
24:38:02,400 --> 24:38:07,959
also done soap so um you know among the

38671
24:38:06,400 --> 24:38:10,871
other emoji that we have worked on are

38672
24:38:07,960 --> 24:38:12,512
sari moon cake llama like uh teddy bear

38673
24:38:10,872 --> 24:38:15,960
there were no toys I felt really sad for

38674
24:38:12,512 --> 24:38:18,160
toys we have like giraffe um there was

38675
24:38:15,960 --> 24:38:20,280
Hut bubble te bubble tea was very

38676
24:38:18,160 --> 24:38:22,120
controversial actually I have to say it

38677
24:38:20,280 --> 24:38:24,160
kind we tried to slide it in originally

38678
24:38:22,120 --> 24:38:26,512
with the um takeout box and the

38679
24:38:24,160 --> 24:38:28,360
dumplings and people were not not having

38680
24:38:26,512 --> 24:38:30,872
it I understand that CU there's not a

38681
24:38:28,360 --> 24:38:32,600
lot like compared to like beer or wine

38682
24:38:30,872 --> 24:38:33,960
like bubble tea does not is not long

38683
24:38:32,600 --> 24:38:39,600
does not have a long history on this

38684
24:38:33,960 --> 24:38:41,680
planet um but I will say that um they

38685
24:38:39,600 --> 24:38:43,320
submitted again actually kind of

38686
24:38:41,680 --> 24:38:45,439
originally proposing that it was not

38687
24:38:43,320 --> 24:38:47,232
just bubble tea but but like a black

38688
24:38:45,440 --> 24:38:49,400
ball and milk and tea it was It was kind

38689
24:38:47,232 --> 24:38:51,120
of cool and I I have to say there was

38690
24:38:49,400 --> 24:38:53,192
definitely a generational divide between

38691
24:38:51,120 --> 24:38:54,959
like the Asian women who sit in that

38692
24:38:53,192 --> 24:38:56,799
room and are like this absolutely is a

38693
24:38:54,960 --> 24:38:58,760
thing that we consume like almost like

38694
24:38:56,800 --> 24:39:00,640
every week of our life and people who

38695
24:38:58,760 --> 24:39:02,159
are a little bit older who are like that

38696
24:39:00,640 --> 24:39:03,319
looks like a parfait how do you not know

38697
24:39:02,160 --> 24:39:05,800
that's a parfet and we're like we

38698
24:39:03,320 --> 24:39:07,600
absolutely know it is uh not a parfait

38699
24:39:05,800 --> 24:39:09,600
and so so it got in eventually so it

38700
24:39:07,600 --> 24:39:12,232
does sort of influence it kind of shows

38701
24:39:09,600 --> 24:39:14,912
like who is in the room influences you

38702
24:39:12,232 --> 24:39:16,760
know the decisions um that get made or

38703
24:39:14,912 --> 24:39:18,912
sometimes in the room now sometimes more

38704
24:39:16,760 --> 24:39:21,400
more likely in the zoom um I actually I

38705
24:39:18,912 --> 24:39:22,912
just say beaver Emoji if you see Beaver

38706
24:39:21,400 --> 24:39:24,680
Emoji that's one of one of the ones I'm

38707
24:39:22,912 --> 24:39:26,040
most proud of so that is actually

38708
24:39:24,680 --> 24:39:29,680
co-authored by a professor here at

38709
24:39:26,040 --> 24:39:31,719
Harvard um who is both lesbian and was

38710
24:39:29,680 --> 24:39:33,599
married to a woman from Canada so it was

38711
24:39:31,720 --> 24:39:36,720
very important to her to get um the

38712
24:39:33,600 --> 24:39:38,320
beaver Emoji passed and she promised me

38713
24:39:36,720 --> 24:39:40,680
it would always be the first line of her

38714
24:39:38,320 --> 24:39:43,720
bio so and indeed if you go to her

38715
24:39:40,680 --> 24:39:46,359
Twitter handle uh it's like Joan Donovan

38716
24:39:43,720 --> 24:39:47,872
creator of the Beaver Emoji comma is

38717
24:39:46,360 --> 24:39:49,960
headed research at the shoren scene

38718
24:39:47,872 --> 24:39:52,832
Center at the Harvard Kennedy School

38719
24:39:49,960 --> 24:39:54,600
It's Kind it's pretty impressive um and

38720
24:39:52,832 --> 24:39:57,439
then we did greens actually greens was

38721
24:39:54,600 --> 24:39:58,960
really interesting because people this

38722
24:39:57,440 --> 24:40:00,512
was also like a generational cultural

38723
24:39:58,960 --> 24:40:02,872
thing people were like why do we need

38724
24:40:00,512 --> 24:40:04,760
greens we have salad and I was like

38725
24:40:02,872 --> 24:40:06,160
we're Chinese we don't eat raw greens

38726
24:40:04,760 --> 24:40:08,231
cuz like you don't know where it's been

38727
24:40:06,160 --> 24:40:09,912
or if it's clean so we cook our greens

38728
24:40:08,232 --> 24:40:13,192
so salad is not something that we have

38729
24:40:09,912 --> 24:40:14,680
So eventually I got my greens and um so

38730
24:40:13,192 --> 24:40:16,080
that was kind of fun and then so these

38731
24:40:14,680 --> 24:40:18,280
are some of the people who sort of have

38732
24:40:16,080 --> 24:40:19,872
contributed to our little Emoji Nation

38733
24:40:18,280 --> 24:40:22,040
things including a number of Native

38734
24:40:19,872 --> 24:40:23,760
Americans who help get feather so why do

38735
24:40:22,040 --> 24:40:25,400
I care so part of it is because I'm

38736
24:40:23,760 --> 24:40:26,760
Chinese I grew up speaking Chinese and

38737
24:40:25,400 --> 24:40:28,720
English at the same time and it's really

38738
24:40:26,760 --> 24:40:31,720
interesting to see like Chinese and

38739
24:40:28,720 --> 24:40:33,832
English characters in terms of emoji and

38740
24:40:31,720 --> 24:40:35,440
Chinese together right so this is fire

38741
24:40:33,832 --> 24:40:36,760
you have like Fire characters and now

38742
24:40:35,440 --> 24:40:38,120
you have the Emoji things and it's kind

38743
24:40:36,760 --> 24:40:40,000
of It kind of shows that there is a

38744
24:40:38,120 --> 24:40:41,480
longevity in The Human Experience of

38745
24:40:40,000 --> 24:40:43,680
something that was designed 4,000 years

38746
24:40:41,480 --> 24:40:47,800
ago as the same visual cues in the human

38747
24:40:43,680 --> 24:40:50,871
experiences as now so mouth Tre tree

38748
24:40:47,800 --> 24:40:54,400
Moon Sun you can mix and match them

38749
24:40:50,872 --> 24:40:57,080
which is super fun um so you know two

38750
24:40:54,400 --> 24:41:01,599
trees kind of make a forest oops sorry

38751
24:40:57,080 --> 24:41:07,000
oh well okay then the um Moon and Sun

38752
24:41:01,600 --> 24:41:08,960
together means bright which I like um I

38753
24:41:07,000 --> 24:41:12,000
like this one so if you stop and you

38754
24:41:08,960 --> 24:41:16,120
think about this so this is a basically

38755
24:41:12,000 --> 24:41:17,480
a pig under a roof and what does that

38756
24:41:16,120 --> 24:41:19,440
mean

38757
24:41:17,480 --> 24:41:22,000
it does not mean Farm as you might think

38758
24:41:19,440 --> 24:41:25,232
it um it actually means home or family

38759
24:41:22,000 --> 24:41:26,480
so in the Chinese kind of structure and

38760
24:41:25,232 --> 24:41:29,320
outlook on The View it's like where you

38761
24:41:26,480 --> 24:41:33,599
keep your pigs is actually where your

38762
24:41:29,320 --> 24:41:35,232
home is and what your farm is um so it

38763
24:41:33,600 --> 24:41:37,040
gets kind of weird in all kinds of ways

38764
24:41:35,232 --> 24:41:42,280
so one of my favorite radicals so this

38765
24:41:37,040 --> 24:41:44,640
character means woman uh KN

38766
24:41:42,280 --> 24:41:46,912
and as I was learning Chinese you kind

38767
24:41:44,640 --> 24:41:49,600
of notice like how it shows up so so

38768
24:41:46,912 --> 24:41:52,552
this is a woman underneath a roof and

38769
24:41:49,600 --> 24:41:55,720
you're like oh it means mom or wife or

38770
24:41:52,552 --> 24:41:59,832
or like whatever like home um it does

38771
24:41:55,720 --> 24:42:02,720
not it means peace because things are at

38772
24:41:59,832 --> 24:42:04,959
home when the woman is or things are at

38773
24:42:02,720 --> 24:42:06,280
peace when the woman is at home

38774
24:42:04,960 --> 24:42:09,040
underneath a roof which I always thought

38775
24:42:06,280 --> 24:42:13,232
was a little bit odd um then there is

38776
24:42:09,040 --> 24:42:15,511
also uh woman plus child so you're like

38777
24:42:13,232 --> 24:42:16,512
oh and actually specifically Boy Child

38778
24:42:15,512 --> 24:42:18,192
the connotation there is a little

38779
24:42:16,512 --> 24:42:21,480
unclear so you're like a woman plus

38780
24:42:18,192 --> 24:42:23,720
child family mom you know whatever um it

38781
24:42:21,480 --> 24:42:25,512
is not it means good so the standard for

38782
24:42:23,720 --> 24:42:27,800
goodness in ancient China was a woman

38783
24:42:25,512 --> 24:42:30,872
who had a male child child so that kind

38784
24:42:27,800 --> 24:42:32,600
of kind of just like kind of irked me um

38785
24:42:30,872 --> 24:42:34,680
growing up and then you know three women

38786
24:42:32,600 --> 24:42:36,080
together means evil which is like very

38787
24:42:34,680 --> 24:42:40,192
like

38788
24:42:36,080 --> 24:42:43,120
MCB this character means greed this

38789
24:42:40,192 --> 24:42:45,512
character means slave this marriage

38790
24:42:43,120 --> 24:42:47,871
let's see I think this one is jealousy

38791
24:42:45,512 --> 24:42:51,192
and this means means adultery or

38792
24:42:47,872 --> 24:42:53,720
betrayal so like definitely not loving

38793
24:42:51,192 --> 24:42:56,192
the way women were P you know portrayed

38794
24:42:53,720 --> 24:42:57,512
um on the emoji keyboard so uh in case

38795
24:42:56,192 --> 24:42:58,912
you're wondering we just came out with a

38796
24:42:57,512 --> 24:43:01,832
kids book called had emoji that kind of

38797
24:42:58,912 --> 24:43:03,800
Compares emoji and uh Chinese and I

38798
24:43:01,832 --> 24:43:05,480
think I I think they sent a bunch of

38799
24:43:03,800 --> 24:43:08,912
books so that you guys can do some kind

38800
24:43:05,480 --> 24:43:10,720
of contest some like later on with cs50

38801
24:43:08,912 --> 24:43:13,280
um so but the mixing and matching is

38802
24:43:10,720 --> 24:43:16,440
really interesting right for example the

38803
24:43:13,280 --> 24:43:18,400
skin tones are actually the same yellow

38804
24:43:16,440 --> 24:43:20,512
character plus a layer of skin tone on

38805
24:43:18,400 --> 24:43:22,720
top of this so I kind of took my lessons

38806
24:43:20,512 --> 24:43:23,832
from Chinese in terms of seeing how

38807
24:43:22,720 --> 24:43:25,320
things can be binded so there's

38808
24:43:23,832 --> 24:43:27,760
something you should know about which is

38809
24:43:25,320 --> 24:43:30,000
zge this is also an invisible emoji

38810
24:43:27,760 --> 24:43:31,480
character it stands for zero with Joiner

38811
24:43:30,000 --> 24:43:34,320
and it was actually originally created

38812
24:43:31,480 --> 24:43:36,159
mostly for I think Arabic where you

38813
24:43:34,320 --> 24:43:37,512
would you would basically kind of force

38814
24:43:36,160 --> 24:43:39,320
something to have like be in the

38815
24:43:37,512 --> 24:43:41,400
beginning of of a word or an end of the

38816
24:43:39,320 --> 24:43:43,440
word by kind of having this like

38817
24:43:41,400 --> 24:43:45,599
invisible character so the rainbow flag

38818
24:43:43,440 --> 24:43:47,120
for example is actually a rainbow plus

38819
24:43:45,600 --> 24:43:50,080
the white flag

38820
24:43:47,120 --> 24:43:52,360
um and we we could have all kinds of fun

38821
24:43:50,080 --> 24:43:54,480
combinations if you look at polar bear

38822
24:43:52,360 --> 24:43:56,480
it actually is if you have an older

38823
24:43:54,480 --> 24:43:59,000
device or it breaks apart it is bear

38824
24:43:56,480 --> 24:44:01,832
plus snow which is really cute it was

38825
24:43:59,000 --> 24:44:04,080
originally I had bear plus white and

38826
24:44:01,832 --> 24:44:06,799
then we decided that bear plus snow made

38827
24:44:04,080 --> 24:44:09,480
a lot more sense so uh another one this

38828
24:44:06,800 --> 24:44:11,040
is new I I think if you guys should have

38829
24:44:09,480 --> 24:44:13,120
it if you've updated your phones in the

38830
24:44:11,040 --> 24:44:15,079
last year or so so mending heart is

38831
24:44:13,120 --> 24:44:17,440
heart plus

38832
24:44:15,080 --> 24:44:20,000
Band-Aid um um what is this one oh this

38833
24:44:17,440 --> 24:44:22,192
is interesting um there was a

38834
24:44:20,000 --> 24:44:23,400
breastfeeding woman for a long time and

38835
24:44:22,192 --> 24:44:24,912
people felt like there was not gender

38836
24:44:23,400 --> 24:44:26,640
par was actually really interesting all

38837
24:44:24,912 --> 24:44:28,959
the people who wrote it and were like I

38838
24:44:26,640 --> 24:44:30,552
want to I want to be a dad showing that

38839
24:44:28,960 --> 24:44:32,760
I'm holding my baby why is there only a

38840
24:44:30,552 --> 24:44:36,080
woman holding my baby so so we kind of

38841
24:44:32,760 --> 24:44:39,680
created a whole set so this is man plus

38842
24:44:36,080 --> 24:44:41,800
bottle Tada um and so this is and all of

38843
24:44:39,680 --> 24:44:43,719
these occupations are actually often

38844
24:44:41,800 --> 24:44:47,000
times a woman plus like you know the

38845
24:44:43,720 --> 24:44:48,192
fried egg or like um a school or a

38846
24:44:47,000 --> 24:44:50,320
tractor and that's how you got the

38847
24:44:48,192 --> 24:44:53,120
occupations if you if you if you send an

38848
24:44:50,320 --> 24:44:55,120
emoji over into an older system

38849
24:44:53,120 --> 24:44:56,640
sometimes you'll it'll break apart so

38850
24:44:55,120 --> 24:44:58,640
one of my kind of favorite kind of

38851
24:44:56,640 --> 24:45:00,319
contributions in this in this world is

38852
24:44:58,640 --> 24:45:03,120
interracial couple Emoji which we did

38853
24:45:00,320 --> 24:45:04,512
with um Tinder which is super fun

38854
24:45:03,120 --> 24:45:06,912
because then you could have you know

38855
24:45:04,512 --> 24:45:08,680
different couples that are and and like

38856
24:45:06,912 --> 24:45:10,000
so many combin this is like this is a

38857
24:45:08,680 --> 24:45:12,439
fun if you guys ever have to do a

38858
24:45:10,000 --> 24:45:14,680
combinatoric test um this is really fun

38859
24:45:12,440 --> 24:45:18,080
because you have two genders plus a

38860
24:45:14,680 --> 24:45:20,192
third like gender plus two people plus

38861
24:45:18,080 --> 24:45:22,832
five skin tones plus yellow like how

38862
24:45:20,192 --> 24:45:25,440
many Emoji couples can you come come up

38863
24:45:22,832 --> 24:45:27,720
with when you introduce this Factor so

38864
24:45:25,440 --> 24:45:28,872
this is um and underneath it it's just a

38865
24:45:27,720 --> 24:45:30,600
wige sequence it's like two people

38866
24:45:28,872 --> 24:45:32,440
standing together that are like glued

38867
24:45:30,600 --> 24:45:34,232
together now this actually gets

38868
24:45:32,440 --> 24:45:36,360
interesting from a cs-50 perspective

38869
24:45:34,232 --> 24:45:38,912
because in many cases even though you

38870
24:45:36,360 --> 24:45:41,040
only see one character underneath the

38871
24:45:38,912 --> 24:45:42,832
hood depending on how your system works

38872
24:45:41,040 --> 24:45:44,439
they're counting each one of these as an

38873
24:45:42,832 --> 24:45:46,080
individual character so your string

38874
24:45:44,440 --> 24:45:47,960
length actually might be five and

38875
24:45:46,080 --> 24:45:49,000
instead of one and this this kind of

38876
24:45:47,960 --> 24:45:51,280
became a problem with things like

38877
24:45:49,000 --> 24:45:53,872
Twitter where things had a hard skin um

38878
24:45:51,280 --> 24:45:54,912
length so gender inclusivity um is

38879
24:45:53,872 --> 24:45:58,120
actually one of the things that we've

38880
24:45:54,912 --> 24:46:00,160
been dealing most with um in the last

38881
24:45:58,120 --> 24:46:01,871
couple years so it's kind of interesting

38882
24:46:00,160 --> 24:46:03,512
if you think about both what a pictorial

38883
24:46:01,872 --> 24:46:06,080
language looks like versus the

38884
24:46:03,512 --> 24:46:08,120
abstractness of a of a spoken language

38885
24:46:06,080 --> 24:46:08,912
so because you know we had boy and we

38886
24:46:08,120 --> 24:46:11,000
had

38887
24:46:08,912 --> 24:46:13,160
girl but there was no way to say a

38888
24:46:11,000 --> 24:46:14,440
generic child right like if you were on

38889
24:46:13,160 --> 24:46:16,912
you wanted to say child you had to pick

38890
24:46:14,440 --> 24:46:19,640
a boy or a girl but not a way to say

38891
24:46:16,912 --> 24:46:21,680
like just some little person and that's

38892
24:46:19,640 --> 24:46:24,160
really key cuz in English at least there

38893
24:46:21,680 --> 24:46:27,871
is no gender implied by

38894
24:46:24,160 --> 24:46:29,960
child um so how do we mimic that and it

38895
24:46:27,872 --> 24:46:32,912
also is key for something like doctor

38896
24:46:29,960 --> 24:46:35,080
right doctor and teacher those are those

38897
24:46:32,912 --> 24:46:36,959
have don't have gender implied but when

38898
24:46:35,080 --> 24:46:39,680
we have them on on the Emoji Keyboard

38899
24:46:36,960 --> 24:46:43,280
you to pick a male teacher or um you

38900
24:46:39,680 --> 24:46:45,760
know a a a female doctor or whatnot so

38901
24:46:43,280 --> 24:46:47,800
there was actually uh a guy at Adobe who

38902
24:46:45,760 --> 24:46:50,720
can considers himself non-gender binary

38903
24:46:47,800 --> 24:46:55,192
also The Man Behind the orange um the

38904
24:46:50,720 --> 24:46:58,320
orange heart he fought and got basically

38905
24:46:55,192 --> 24:47:01,512
uh the first three non-gender uh

38906
24:46:58,320 --> 24:47:03,640
non-gender binary emojis so child adult

38907
24:47:01,512 --> 24:47:05,800
and old older adults so those are

38908
24:47:03,640 --> 24:47:07,280
creative and then we started having to

38909
24:47:05,800 --> 24:47:08,680
propagate them through actually all the

38910
24:47:07,280 --> 24:47:11,400
occupations so these are the gender

38911
24:47:08,680 --> 24:47:13,511
neutral versions of many of those um but

38912
24:47:11,400 --> 24:47:15,400
then uh we got into this whole thing

38913
24:47:13,512 --> 24:47:17,160
where every emoji that had a gender

38914
24:47:15,400 --> 24:47:19,159
originally had to be mirrored so

38915
24:47:17,160 --> 24:47:20,640
originally we had bearded man and then

38916
24:47:19,160 --> 24:47:22,512
we're like okay well we actually have to

38917
24:47:20,640 --> 24:47:24,760
get bearded woman so that is on your

38918
24:47:22,512 --> 24:47:28,192
keyboard there is pregnant woman there

38919
24:47:24,760 --> 24:47:31,231
is now pregnant man which is interesting

38920
24:47:28,192 --> 24:47:34,192
um there is you know woman in a bridal

38921
24:47:31,232 --> 24:47:35,512
gown there's now man in a bridal gown um

38922
24:47:34,192 --> 24:47:38,120
and then there were ones that actually

38923
24:47:35,512 --> 24:47:40,232
had to be created that were neither man

38924
24:47:38,120 --> 24:47:41,760
or woman so this is a mer person so

38925
24:47:40,232 --> 24:47:42,800
there was merman there was mermaid and

38926
24:47:41,760 --> 24:47:43,959
there was M person it was really

38927
24:47:42,800 --> 24:47:46,512
interesting to figure out like how do

38928
24:47:43,960 --> 24:47:47,640
you draw a gender neutral M person like

38929
24:47:46,512 --> 24:47:49,280
a bunch of them in the beginning

38930
24:47:47,640 --> 24:47:51,680
actually had the arms crossed around

38931
24:47:49,280 --> 24:47:53,480
sort of the chest um Monarch so there

38932
24:47:51,680 --> 24:47:55,760
was prince and princess and now there is

38933
24:47:53,480 --> 24:47:57,280
monarch and one of my favorite actually

38934
24:47:55,760 --> 24:47:59,720
is there was Santa Claus and there was

38935
24:47:57,280 --> 24:48:01,480
Mrs Claus and now there's MX Claus like

38936
24:47:59,720 --> 24:48:03,400
the name of this character literally in

38937
24:48:01,480 --> 24:48:05,000
Unicode is MX claw so I feel like it's

38938
24:48:03,400 --> 24:48:09,360
sort of like a very official enshrining

38939
24:48:05,000 --> 24:48:10,832
of gender non biner in like the world um

38940
24:48:09,360 --> 24:48:12,912
not everyone loved it New York Post did

38941
24:48:10,832 --> 24:48:14,799
not love this that they like you know

38942
24:48:12,912 --> 24:48:18,280
we're we're cing into like Emoji woke

38943
24:48:14,800 --> 24:48:19,640
Wars um so some Emoji stats for you this

38944
24:48:18,280 --> 24:48:22,400
is very fascinating this is sort of like

38945
24:48:19,640 --> 24:48:24,160
the Gen the General Distribution by far

38946
24:48:22,400 --> 24:48:26,439
the single emoji that used more than

38947
24:48:24,160 --> 24:48:29,480
anything else is the face with tears of

38948
24:48:26,440 --> 24:48:31,600
joy about 10% of all Emoji scent is that

38949
24:48:29,480 --> 24:48:33,832
one character and then number two is

38950
24:48:31,600 --> 24:48:36,400
heart red heart and then it kind of goes

38951
24:48:33,832 --> 24:48:39,280
down so um there's a frequency of emoji

38952
24:48:36,400 --> 24:48:43,439
use these this is sort of done by um

38953
24:48:39,280 --> 24:48:46,000
order magnitude so one is half of two

38954
24:48:43,440 --> 24:48:47,480
two is half of one so it's really

38955
24:48:46,000 --> 24:48:49,680
interesting it's a very very steep drop

38956
24:48:47,480 --> 24:48:52,360
off after the first couple um in case

38957
24:48:49,680 --> 24:48:54,871
you ever want to go onto the the Emoji

38958
24:48:52,360 --> 24:48:57,280
kind of Unicode website you can you too

38959
24:48:54,872 --> 24:48:58,552
can see all the frequency things so I

38960
24:48:57,280 --> 24:49:01,040
think it's really funny so basically

38961
24:48:58,552 --> 24:49:03,800
it's green going this way it increased

38962
24:49:01,040 --> 24:49:06,159
in usage between 2019 and uh 2021 and

38963
24:49:03,800 --> 24:49:08,400
it's red going this way it drop and so

38964
24:49:06,160 --> 24:49:10,680
pleading face which is a relatively new

38965
24:49:08,400 --> 24:49:14,319
emoe you just sort of shut up on the

38966
24:49:10,680 --> 24:49:16,552
charts um and whereas actually like

38967
24:49:14,320 --> 24:49:19,000
smiling face with heart eyes

38968
24:49:16,552 --> 24:49:21,512
like kind of kind of slipped which is

38969
24:49:19,000 --> 24:49:23,512
interesting so we just closed our Emoji

38970
24:49:21,512 --> 24:49:25,360
proposal round for 2022 these were sort

38971
24:49:23,512 --> 24:49:27,120
of the breakdowns people love submitting

38972
24:49:25,360 --> 24:49:29,640
Smileys and food and beverages animals

38973
24:49:27,120 --> 24:49:31,552
and nature da da da I don't I mean these

38974
24:49:29,640 --> 24:49:34,080
are very googly colors um so what is the

38975
24:49:31,552 --> 24:49:35,720
future of emoji I will um I will tell

38976
24:49:34,080 --> 24:49:37,760
you because we just had a meeting two

38977
24:49:35,720 --> 24:49:39,912
weeks ago so I can now publicly talk

38978
24:49:37,760 --> 24:49:41,439
about it so historically there was this

38979
24:49:39,912 --> 24:49:45,512
whole idea like Unico doesn't want to be

38980
24:49:41,440 --> 24:49:47,400
in the world of like encoding glyphs for

38981
24:49:45,512 --> 24:49:48,720
like devices everywhere like there was

38982
24:49:47,400 --> 24:49:50,000
very controversial when it started doing

38983
24:49:48,720 --> 24:49:52,320
that because mostly what Unicode used to

38984
24:49:50,000 --> 24:49:54,280
do was you take an existing language

38985
24:49:52,320 --> 24:49:56,120
could be dead you know and then it would

38986
24:49:54,280 --> 24:49:58,360
just take it and digitize it right it

38987
24:49:56,120 --> 24:50:01,599
took languages that existed and just

38988
24:49:58,360 --> 24:50:03,512
digitize them and uh then when it kind

38989
24:50:01,600 --> 24:50:06,912
of wandered into Emoji World Suddenly

38990
24:50:03,512 --> 24:50:10,360
It's like deciding what deserves to be

38991
24:50:06,912 --> 24:50:12,912
like an emoji decides to be digitized so

38992
24:50:10,360 --> 24:50:14,912
um trying to get kind of get out of it

38993
24:50:12,912 --> 24:50:16,440
and they have proposals over time where

38994
24:50:14,912 --> 24:50:18,512
it's like oh maybe we should like come

38995
24:50:16,440 --> 24:50:21,232
up with a a way to just send pictures

38996
24:50:18,512 --> 24:50:24,600
back and forth where you you it's a

38997
24:50:21,232 --> 24:50:26,640
fixed picture and you like use a hash so

38998
24:50:24,600 --> 24:50:28,640
that you know like we would look at the

38999
24:50:26,640 --> 24:50:30,832
picture and then like go do a lookup

39000
24:50:28,640 --> 24:50:32,080
somewhere like that did not go over well

39001
24:50:30,832 --> 24:50:34,552
then there was actually a really

39002
24:50:32,080 --> 24:50:35,800
interesting proposal I kind of like uh

39003
24:50:34,552 --> 24:50:37,760
didn't go over well which is using

39004
24:50:35,800 --> 24:50:40,000
something called the qid which is in

39005
24:50:37,760 --> 24:50:43,640
Wiki in the Wikipedia world so in

39006
24:50:40,000 --> 24:50:45,680
Wikipedia World items all have uh

39007
24:50:43,640 --> 24:50:49,040
numbers across the different language

39008
24:50:45,680 --> 24:50:51,912
Wikipedia so Obama human Earth they will

39009
24:50:49,040 --> 24:50:53,599
have an ID number so that the page in

39010
24:50:51,912 --> 24:50:55,040
English and the page in German the page

39011
24:50:53,600 --> 24:50:56,832
in Chinese all know that they're

39012
24:50:55,040 --> 24:50:58,400
pointing to the same thing so the

39013
24:50:56,832 --> 24:51:00,120
question so one idea came up like why

39014
24:50:58,400 --> 24:51:02,760
don't we use the numbering system so we

39015
24:51:00,120 --> 24:51:04,871
can use like Eiffel Tower in you know

39016
24:51:02,760 --> 24:51:06,599
see the number and then like oh people

39017
24:51:04,872 --> 24:51:08,400
know like oh you're trying to say Eiffel

39018
24:51:06,600 --> 24:51:09,912
Tower that did not go over well so those

39019
24:51:08,400 --> 24:51:13,319
are both both of those proposals seem

39020
24:51:09,912 --> 24:51:14,640
dead as of yet um and it's too bad cuz

39021
24:51:13,320 --> 24:51:16,680
and you'll see kind of what's happening

39022
24:51:14,640 --> 24:51:19,000
okay so what's coming in 22 so these are

39023
24:51:16,680 --> 24:51:20,280
the Emoji that I actually sort of

39024
24:51:19,000 --> 24:51:21,680
thought they would be on your phones by

39025
24:51:20,280 --> 24:51:23,600
now but cuz we're in mid November and

39026
24:51:21,680 --> 24:51:26,040
they usually update early November so

39027
24:51:23,600 --> 24:51:29,280
three more Hearts people love hearts

39028
24:51:26,040 --> 24:51:31,439
like uh wing blackbird Goose Birds also

39029
24:51:29,280 --> 24:51:33,120
purple flowers jellyfish moose face

39030
24:51:31,440 --> 24:51:36,552
donkey donkey was a little bit late for

39031
24:51:33,120 --> 24:51:40,959
the kind of Elections um Ginger peep pod

39032
24:51:36,552 --> 24:51:42,552
Wireless cond shaking face um folding

39033
24:51:40,960 --> 24:51:44,160
hand pan that one was interesting cuz

39034
24:51:42,552 --> 24:51:46,280
when people first proposed it they

39035
24:51:44,160 --> 24:51:49,360
proposed it as like an electric fan and

39036
24:51:46,280 --> 24:51:50,640
that didn't like who knows what electric

39037
24:51:49,360 --> 24:51:51,872
fans will look like in 100 years because

39038
24:51:50,640 --> 24:51:54,160
the thing is Once An Emoji always an

39039
24:51:51,872 --> 24:51:55,680
emoji they never retire so they're

39040
24:51:54,160 --> 24:51:58,760
always looking for things that have a

39041
24:51:55,680 --> 24:52:00,439
long visual longevity floppy disc did

39042
24:51:58,760 --> 24:52:02,159
not actually do that so there's always

39043
24:52:00,440 --> 24:52:04,120
like we don't want another floppy disc

39044
24:52:02,160 --> 24:52:06,960
um and then hairpick is interesting so

39045
24:52:04,120 --> 24:52:10,871
there was a whole debate about how to

39046
24:52:06,960 --> 24:52:12,232
convey um like afro African hair like

39047
24:52:10,872 --> 24:52:13,720
the the curly hair that they introduced

39048
24:52:12,232 --> 24:52:15,680
a couple years ago was supposed to do

39049
24:52:13,720 --> 24:52:17,552
that and most of the vendors actually

39050
24:52:15,680 --> 24:52:19,511
have it in a sort of Afro way except for

39051
24:52:17,552 --> 24:52:21,280
Apple so there's a lot of complaints but

39052
24:52:19,512 --> 24:52:23,600
um hairpick was sort of a an interesting

39053
24:52:21,280 --> 24:52:25,360
way it means both comb but also has sort

39054
24:52:23,600 --> 24:52:27,080
of an interesting historic connotation

39055
24:52:25,360 --> 24:52:29,512
and it's been around for about 2,000

39056
24:52:27,080 --> 24:52:31,960
years uh a couple music things maracus

39057
24:52:29,512 --> 24:52:34,120
and flute uh Beyond 2022 one of the

39058
24:52:31,960 --> 24:52:36,832
things that's going to die oops can I go

39059
24:52:34,120 --> 24:52:41,319
back no I can't oh well uh we're going

39060
24:52:36,832 --> 24:52:42,720
to retire the the family Emoji um they

39061
24:52:41,320 --> 24:52:44,800
didn't go over so well there were so

39062
24:52:42,720 --> 24:52:48,320
many of them combinatorically if you had

39063
24:52:44,800 --> 24:52:50,320
all the everything in in uh you know all

39064
24:52:48,320 --> 24:52:52,320
the race all the races all because you

39065
24:52:50,320 --> 24:52:53,400
wanted to have skin tones because you

39066
24:52:52,320 --> 24:52:56,000
didn't want to imply that families can

39067
24:52:53,400 --> 24:52:57,871
only be one race it was such an ordeal

39068
24:52:56,000 --> 24:52:59,960
uh essentially we're all like no one

39069
24:52:57,872 --> 24:53:02,160
uses them and there's so many and it's

39070
24:52:59,960 --> 24:53:03,720
like the fonts like in terms of the load

39071
24:53:02,160 --> 24:53:05,440
is like too large so they're just going

39072
24:53:03,720 --> 24:53:08,280
to make them all into like basically

39073
24:53:05,440 --> 24:53:10,232
little like bathroom symbol Type U folks

39074
24:53:08,280 --> 24:53:11,512
um so I think that is those will

39075
24:53:10,232 --> 24:53:13,600
disappear what what's actually really

39076
24:53:11,512 --> 24:53:15,040
interesting about the family Emoji is

39077
24:53:13,600 --> 24:53:17,192
they had gay when they introduced the

39078
24:53:15,040 --> 24:53:19,760
family they had gay family emoji and the

39079
24:53:17,192 --> 24:53:21,080
Russian government went berserk and

39080
24:53:19,760 --> 24:53:22,871
actually you can Google this in 2015

39081
24:53:21,080 --> 24:53:24,680
you'll see a bunch of articles about

39082
24:53:22,872 --> 24:53:26,480
like the Russian government considering

39083
24:53:24,680 --> 24:53:27,760
it homosexual propaganda to Youth and

39084
24:53:26,480 --> 24:53:29,120
there was a big debate about whether or

39085
24:53:27,760 --> 24:53:30,599
not they were going to ban Apple devices

39086
24:53:29,120 --> 24:53:32,760
and what so you can see a lot of the

39087
24:53:30,600 --> 24:53:34,872
media coverage from that time but I

39088
24:53:32,760 --> 24:53:36,400
thought it was really interesting how

39089
24:53:34,872 --> 24:53:39,912
upset a national government can get

39090
24:53:36,400 --> 24:53:41,400
about little pictures on your phone um

39091
24:53:39,912 --> 24:53:43,400
another thing that's going to that's on

39092
24:53:41,400 --> 24:53:46,231
the agenda as of you know a couple of

39093
24:53:43,400 --> 24:53:48,120
weeks ago is directionality in terms of

39094
24:53:46,232 --> 24:53:49,680
emoji so as you know most emojis kind of

39095
24:53:48,120 --> 24:53:52,280
just flip one way or another and the

39096
24:53:49,680 --> 24:53:54,480
reason why it matters is because not all

39097
24:53:52,280 --> 24:53:57,640
languages run in the same direction so

39098
24:53:54,480 --> 24:53:59,480
for example Arabic so we are used to

39099
24:53:57,640 --> 24:54:02,400
left to right but a lot of languages go

39100
24:53:59,480 --> 24:54:04,000
right to left um so and this kind of It

39101
24:54:02,400 --> 24:54:06,439
kind of changes the meaning of emoji for

39102
24:54:04,000 --> 24:54:07,872
example right to left I send this a lot

39103
24:54:06,440 --> 24:54:12,800
to my friends when I'm going flying from

39104
24:54:07,872 --> 24:54:14,832
the Bay Area to New York um if you do it

39105
24:54:12,800 --> 24:54:16,960
from left to right however that is what

39106
24:54:14,832 --> 24:54:18,231
it looks like so it looks like um you

39107
24:54:16,960 --> 24:54:20,480
know you're in NE Bay but the plane is

39108
24:54:18,232 --> 24:54:22,960
still going that you know kind of up and

39109
24:54:20,480 --> 24:54:24,480
to the right and then now it looks like

39110
24:54:22,960 --> 24:54:26,760
you're going from New York to the Bay

39111
24:54:24,480 --> 24:54:28,360
Area the other place is like oh it's

39112
24:54:26,760 --> 24:54:31,319
it's a girl and she's running really

39113
24:54:28,360 --> 24:54:33,720
fast right uh that is left to right to

39114
24:54:31,320 --> 24:54:34,872
left in our world wait left to right

39115
24:54:33,720 --> 24:54:36,440
sorry sorry that was that's that's

39116
24:54:34,872 --> 24:54:39,400
supposed to be left to right and in here

39117
24:54:36,440 --> 24:54:40,600
it would be she's like behind like

39118
24:54:39,400 --> 24:54:42,760
pollution or something like that so

39119
24:54:40,600 --> 24:54:44,280
sorry about so so an example this is

39120
24:54:42,760 --> 24:54:46,159
actually in The Proposal like in one

39121
24:54:44,280 --> 24:54:48,232
case if it's left or right you're

39122
24:54:46,160 --> 24:54:50,280
running away from a line of cars and the

39123
24:54:48,232 --> 24:54:53,232
other one it's a warning to not run

39124
24:54:50,280 --> 24:54:54,680
behind car fumes so they are trying to

39125
24:54:53,232 --> 24:54:57,360
figure out like how do we mirror a bunch

39126
24:54:54,680 --> 24:55:00,439
of the Emoji um but the LA the main

39127
24:54:57,360 --> 24:55:01,600
thing that I think sort of I don't know

39128
24:55:00,440 --> 24:55:03,280
when it's going to happen I'm really

39129
24:55:01,600 --> 24:55:05,000
hopeful is going to happen is trying to

39130
24:55:03,280 --> 24:55:08,480
come up with a system that supports

39131
24:55:05,000 --> 24:55:11,960
little stickers in line that don't need

39132
24:55:08,480 --> 24:55:14,040
Unicode so this is like slack or on um

39133
24:55:11,960 --> 24:55:15,872
twitch you can embed little pictures on

39134
24:55:14,040 --> 24:55:18,511
in line and all all all the vendors have

39135
24:55:15,872 --> 24:55:19,760
to get together and agree to come up

39136
24:55:18,512 --> 24:55:21,800
with a standard way to do that they have

39137
24:55:19,760 --> 24:55:23,552
not yet come up with that but that is

39138
24:55:21,800 --> 24:55:26,440
sort of one of the ways that unic coded

39139
24:55:23,552 --> 24:55:28,319
like want it wants to back away from

39140
24:55:26,440 --> 24:55:31,080
actually being like a global regulator

39141
24:55:28,320 --> 24:55:34,360
for like little colorful glyphs and so

39142
24:55:31,080 --> 24:55:36,960
if you ever need to reach me um on in my

39143
24:55:34,360 --> 24:55:39,160
emoji world you can find me um Jenny

39144
24:55:36,960 --> 24:55:42,640
EmojiNation org there will

39145
24:55:39,160 --> 24:55:44,600
be um the it will be actually a while I

39146
24:55:42,640 --> 24:55:46,552
think before we see a next generation of

39147
24:55:44,600 --> 24:55:47,832
emoji showing up in it used to be like

39148
24:55:46,552 --> 24:55:49,440
every year they would get new code

39149
24:55:47,832 --> 24:55:51,439
points it might be a little bit less

39150
24:55:49,440 --> 24:55:54,160
than every year now as they work on

39151
24:55:51,440 --> 24:55:56,160
things like directionality over time so

39152
24:55:54,160 --> 24:55:58,552
that uh if anyone has questions you can

39153
24:55:56,160 --> 24:56:00,480
ask questions you can find me afterwards

39154
24:55:58,552 --> 24:56:03,120
I think I've I feel like there's

39155
24:56:00,480 --> 24:56:06,872
supposed to be some some hubub right now

39156
24:56:03,120 --> 24:56:09,231
about maybe maybe

39157
24:56:06,872 --> 24:56:11,000
um microphones but maybe not but maybe

39158
24:56:09,232 --> 24:56:12,680
I'm just done and if if there are

39159
24:56:11,000 --> 24:56:14,680
questions or if David is around I'm

39160
24:56:12,680 --> 24:56:17,439
happy you know he can I'm I'm happy to

39161
24:56:14,680 --> 24:56:20,799
to answer any questions that folks have

39162
24:56:17,440 --> 24:56:22,760
yes hi yes I was wondering what were

39163
24:56:20,800 --> 24:56:25,440
your thoughts on the

39164
24:56:22,760 --> 24:56:26,511
emo so the question is what are my

39165
24:56:25,440 --> 24:56:29,552
thoughts on the Emoji Movie you're

39166
24:56:26,512 --> 24:56:32,232
talking about the Sony animated one yes

39167
24:56:29,552 --> 24:56:35,400
okay my thought on that is it is better

39168
24:56:32,232 --> 24:56:37,000
than a 6% rating on um Rotten Tomatoes

39169
24:56:35,400 --> 24:56:39,912
would lead you to believe so that's my

39170
24:56:37,000 --> 24:56:42,600
one thought and my my next thought is

39171
24:56:39,912 --> 24:56:45,160
that um that was a rush job from an

39172
24:56:42,600 --> 24:56:48,720
animation perspective that was that was

39173
24:56:45,160 --> 24:56:51,160
was about 18 months of whereas a typical

39174
24:56:48,720 --> 24:56:52,640
animated movie takes four years so in my

39175
24:56:51,160 --> 24:56:55,040
spare time I also produce movies and

39176
24:56:52,640 --> 24:56:56,400
documentaries so one thing that is key

39177
24:56:55,040 --> 24:57:00,319
to know

39178
24:56:56,400 --> 24:57:01,832
about about movies and animated movies

39179
24:57:00,320 --> 24:57:04,960
and this is very important they take a

39180
24:57:01,832 --> 24:57:07,280
very long time but you can always fix it

39181
24:57:04,960 --> 24:57:08,760
because you haven't shot anything and a

39182
24:57:07,280 --> 24:57:10,872
very good example of that is I assume

39183
24:57:08,760 --> 24:57:12,439
you guys have seen Frozen if you haven't

39184
24:57:10,872 --> 24:57:14,800
seen you seen of the age you would have

39185
24:57:12,440 --> 24:57:17,760
seen Frozen um I do not understand like

39186
24:57:14,800 --> 24:57:21,160
how huge and a phenomenon or why it was

39187
24:57:17,760 --> 24:57:24,120
such a huge phenomenon but

39188
24:57:21,160 --> 24:57:26,680
um they actually did a original cut of

39189
24:57:24,120 --> 24:57:28,599
Frozen and it did so I don't know you

39190
24:57:26,680 --> 24:57:29,959
guys know the the Eye the the sort of

39191
24:57:28,600 --> 24:57:32,640
Snow Queen thing but she's like super

39192
24:57:29,960 --> 24:57:34,280
dark and like not fun and like kind of

39193
24:57:32,640 --> 24:57:36,192
evil and like not someone you want to

39194
24:57:34,280 --> 24:57:38,480
like get behind as a character so they

39195
24:57:36,192 --> 24:57:41,480
actually did sort of a rough cut of that

39196
24:57:38,480 --> 24:57:43,000
of Frozen and they came out of that with

39197
24:57:41,480 --> 24:57:46,360
um it's just storyboarding and they're

39198
24:57:43,000 --> 24:57:48,832
like that is not good and they killed it

39199
24:57:46,360 --> 24:57:50,872
so they were like we can't go with this

39200
24:57:48,832 --> 24:57:53,552
and then started from scratch more or

39201
24:57:50,872 --> 24:57:55,720
less again starting with the song um Let

39202
24:57:53,552 --> 24:57:58,000
It Go which is actually written by a kid

39203
24:57:55,720 --> 24:58:00,360
from my elementary school Bobby Lopez or

39204
24:57:58,000 --> 24:58:02,040
co-written by Bobby Lopez um I also

39205
24:58:00,360 --> 24:58:04,440
actually fun fact I also went I would

39206
24:58:02,040 --> 24:58:06,000
took the school bus with uh Lyn mmel

39207
24:58:04,440 --> 24:58:07,760
Miranda so I was a fourth grader when he

39208
24:58:06,000 --> 24:58:09,440
was like a kindergartener so we had a

39209
24:58:07,760 --> 24:58:11,599
very musical Elementary School in New

39210
24:58:09,440 --> 24:58:13,720
York City but the thing is they could

39211
24:58:11,600 --> 24:58:16,000
fix it because they had enough time and

39212
24:58:13,720 --> 24:58:18,760
have enough money not like movies where

39213
24:58:16,000 --> 24:58:20,360
you shoot humans much harder to fix so

39214
24:58:18,760 --> 24:58:21,832
you have the footage that you have and

39215
24:58:20,360 --> 24:58:23,800
you can do little pickups but you can't

39216
24:58:21,832 --> 24:58:26,480
fix it so essentially what happened in

39217
24:58:23,800 --> 24:58:28,400
that case I think um it's 18 months and

39218
24:58:26,480 --> 24:58:30,280
it could have gotten better and a lot of

39219
24:58:28,400 --> 24:58:32,480
the movies that you see with Pixar like

39220
24:58:30,280 --> 24:58:35,232
it's very it's actually sort emotionally

39221
24:58:32,480 --> 24:58:36,912
similar to the movie called inside out

39222
24:58:35,232 --> 24:58:38,960
and uh but inside they just have more

39223
24:58:36,912 --> 24:58:40,232
time and so it's better so as opposed to

39224
24:58:38,960 --> 24:58:44,160
18 months which is not long enough to

39225
24:58:40,232 --> 24:58:46,760
make a animated movie good but uh the

39226
24:58:44,160 --> 24:58:48,640
other fun thing is is it was the it it

39227
24:58:46,760 --> 24:58:52,192
was so weird cuz they sold sponsorships

39228
24:58:48,640 --> 24:58:55,040
it was like like oh my God here comes

39229
24:58:52,192 --> 24:58:58,040
the Bots and the malware let's go into

39230
24:58:55,040 --> 24:59:00,120
Dropbox and protect ourselves and was so

39231
24:58:58,040 --> 24:59:03,159
I think that it got a lot of like bad

39232
24:59:00,120 --> 24:59:04,552
kind of um kind of uh vibes from the

39233
24:59:03,160 --> 24:59:06,600
from the press for doing things like

39234
24:59:04,552 --> 24:59:09,231
that but from a kids perspective it's

39235
24:59:06,600 --> 24:59:12,280
it's fine I think if um I don't know

39236
24:59:09,232 --> 24:59:13,640
that I would like put into my top 10 of

39237
24:59:12,280 --> 24:59:16,000
animated pictures but it's better than

39238
24:59:13,640 --> 24:59:17,360
6% on Rotten Tomatoes

39239
24:59:16,000 --> 24:59:20,080
and then actually if you guys ever care

39240
24:59:17,360 --> 24:59:22,872
we we have done uh I did a documentary

39241
24:59:20,080 --> 24:59:27,000
about Emoji so and all the people that

39242
24:59:22,872 --> 24:59:30,192
create helped create emoji and uh we did

39243
24:59:27,000 --> 24:59:31,552
a cs50x movie night I think during the

39244
24:59:30,192 --> 24:59:32,959
pandemic was it during the pandemic

39245
24:59:31,552 --> 24:59:35,599
everything sort of like blurred together

39246
24:59:32,960 --> 24:59:40,480
but it was during the pandemic yeah Are

39247
24:59:35,600 --> 24:59:43,040
we more questions yes um I wanted to

39248
24:59:40,480 --> 24:59:46,480
know you mentioned that one of the

39249
24:59:43,040 --> 24:59:51,192
criteria for

39250
24:59:46,480 --> 24:59:51,192
AC do or there's demand

39251
24:59:51,960 --> 24:59:56,192
yeah yeah that's a very good question

39252
24:59:53,960 --> 25:00:00,192
yeah so the question is one of the

39253
24:59:56,192 --> 25:00:01,640
propos one of our criterias of of um

39254
25:00:00,192 --> 25:00:03,912
getting an emoji accepted is to sort of

39255
25:00:01,640 --> 25:00:05,960
to demonstrate demand and how do we

39256
25:00:03,912 --> 25:00:09,360
demonstrate demand and I would say in a

39257
25:00:05,960 --> 25:00:11,480
in a pretty um clumsy way actually at

39258
25:00:09,360 --> 25:00:13,912
this point so the main thing that you

39259
25:00:11,480 --> 25:00:16,720
have in our in our current proposal

39260
25:00:13,912 --> 25:00:18,552
process is we have um a median Emoji

39261
25:00:16,720 --> 25:00:20,160
which is elephant so elephant is like if

39262
25:00:18,552 --> 25:00:21,912
you stack ranked all the emoji for

39263
25:00:20,160 --> 25:00:23,640
popularity elephant is like right there

39264
25:00:21,912 --> 25:00:24,872
in the middle and it's also a concept

39265
25:00:23,640 --> 25:00:25,960
that's like universally understood

39266
25:00:24,872 --> 25:00:29,280
across all

39267
25:00:25,960 --> 25:00:31,720
languages so um elephant shows up

39268
25:00:29,280 --> 25:00:34,080
somewhere between 500 million and 700

39269
25:00:31,720 --> 25:00:36,640
million in Google search results like if

39270
25:00:34,080 --> 25:00:39,000
you type it into a laptop you'll see you

39271
25:00:36,640 --> 25:00:40,680
know elephant 500,000 uh 500 million

39272
25:00:39,000 --> 25:00:42,320
search results and generally you're

39273
25:00:40,680 --> 25:00:46,439
you're trying to when you're comparing

39274
25:00:42,320 --> 25:00:48,512
your term to elephant you want to see

39275
25:00:46,440 --> 25:00:50,160
very roughly how many Google search

39276
25:00:48,512 --> 25:00:52,552
results B search results sometimes

39277
25:00:50,160 --> 25:00:54,232
Instagram so actually something that was

39278
25:00:52,552 --> 25:00:56,512
really surprising to me was someone

39279
25:00:54,232 --> 25:01:01,232
proposed hummingbird I think hummingbird

39280
25:00:56,512 --> 25:01:03,680
is uh a good proposal and um but if you

39281
25:01:01,232 --> 25:01:06,040
look at Hummingbird it's only like 21

39282
25:01:03,680 --> 25:01:08,120
million in terms of the stat so which I

39283
25:01:06,040 --> 25:01:10,552
thought was like very surprisingly low

39284
25:01:08,120 --> 25:01:12,871
so that's one of the main ways that we

39285
25:01:10,552 --> 25:01:16,872
kind of we kind of see like is it also

39286
25:01:12,872 --> 25:01:20,440
visually used and all of that yeah any

39287
25:01:16,872 --> 25:01:22,192
other questions are we good I didn't

39288
25:01:20,440 --> 25:01:23,480
even need my water or anything oh can I

39289
25:01:22,192 --> 25:01:24,912
take I'm going to take a picture I'm

39290
25:01:23,480 --> 25:01:26,192
going to take a picture for because now

39291
25:01:24,912 --> 25:01:28,080
you guys are actually human and not

39292
25:01:26,192 --> 25:01:29,871
Muppets so I'm very very excited about

39293
25:01:28,080 --> 25:01:32,280
this so I will send this to like my

39294
25:01:29,872 --> 25:01:35,320
block mates and be like I just lectured

39295
25:01:32,280 --> 25:01:39,080
at CS you know in Sanders Theater my

39296
25:01:35,320 --> 25:01:41,832
thanks to Jenny Lee thank

39297
25:01:39,080 --> 25:01:43,680
you yeah you can stay up here for give

39298
25:01:41,832 --> 25:01:46,680
me one

39299
25:01:43,680 --> 25:01:46,680
second

39300
25:01:48,680 --> 25:01:53,192
so if up until now thought it would be

39301
25:01:51,320 --> 25:01:54,760
appropriate to toss this up on the board

39302
25:01:53,192 --> 25:01:56,280
if up until now you've not yet gotten

39303
25:01:54,760 --> 25:01:58,192
cs50 stress ball on the way out please

39304
25:01:56,280 --> 25:01:59,800
do grab one we got some extras as well

39305
25:01:58,192 --> 25:02:03,120
off to the side but I would also keep in

39306
25:01:59,800 --> 25:02:04,872
mind back in week zero where again we

39307
25:02:03,120 --> 25:02:06,871
began we asked you to categorize

39308
25:02:04,872 --> 25:02:08,400
yourselves as to whether you are among

39309
25:02:06,872 --> 25:02:09,832
those less comfortable those more

39310
25:02:08,400 --> 25:02:12,079
comfortable or those somewhere in

39311
25:02:09,832 --> 25:02:15,720
between uh please know now that you are

39312
25:02:12,080 --> 25:02:17,480
officially all some uh please know now

39313
25:02:15,720 --> 25:02:19,320
that you are all officially among those

39314
25:02:17,480 --> 25:02:21,000
more comfortable and indeed even though

39315
25:02:19,320 --> 25:02:23,040
a couple of more Milestones await we

39316
25:02:21,000 --> 25:02:26,000
cannot wait to see what you accomplish

39317
25:02:23,040 --> 25:02:31,640
with your final projects in the meantime

39318
25:02:26,000 --> 25:02:31,640
as always this is and now this was

39319
25:02:43,552 --> 25:02:46,552

Mr when

39324
25:03:08,912 --> 25:03:19,400
I in CS I'll say truth be told I thought

39325
25:03:13,680 --> 25:03:19,400
i' be real coding hero because I did

39326
25:03:20,080 --> 25:03:28,160
so it picked up so fast turn out that

39327
25:03:24,600 --> 25:03:29,850
harder scratch hell world and

39328
25:03:28,160 --> 25:03:31,820

Mr I was on

39333
25:03:42,120 --> 25:03:50,080
the trying so hard not fall behind

39334
25:03:46,512 --> 25:03:53,640
attending section and wanting a stuck in

39335
25:03:50,080 --> 25:03:53,640
the in void of my

39336
25:03:56,280 --> 25:04:05,360
computer to pyth in why on because this

39337
25:04:02,832 --> 25:04:05,360
is

s Mr s we completed

39340
25:04:15,720 --> 25:04:24,360
JavaScript sequ CSS

39341
25:04:18,232 --> 25:04:24,360
and every language our to reset don't

[Music]

39343
25:04:29,320 --> 25:04:36,440
get again I repli

all right so this is cs50 my name is

39356
25:06:43,680 --> 25:06:46,760
David May and this is Harvard

39357
25:06:45,280 --> 25:06:48,400
University's introduction to the

39358
25:06:46,760 --> 25:06:50,832
intellectual Enterprises of computer

39359
25:06:48,400 --> 25:06:52,640
science and the Art of programming and

39360
25:06:50,832 --> 25:06:54,480
this of course is our special family

39361
25:06:52,640 --> 25:06:56,192
weekend wherein not only are cs50's own

39362
25:06:54,480 --> 25:06:58,440
students here in the audience but also

39363
25:06:56,192 --> 25:07:00,192
some family members as well now you're

39364
25:06:58,440 --> 25:07:02,400
showing up in the semester a little bit

39365
25:07:00,192 --> 25:07:04,192
late we've just tackled week eight which

39366
25:07:02,400 --> 25:07:05,871
is really our ninth week since computer

39367
25:07:04,192 --> 25:07:07,360
scientists start counting from zero so

39368
25:07:05,872 --> 25:07:09,000
we've done a whole lot of work over the

39369
25:07:07,360 --> 25:07:11,192
past few weeks as you might have heard

39370
25:07:09,000 --> 25:07:13,872
via emails or text messages home

39371
25:07:11,192 --> 25:07:15,440
including a language known here as binar

39372
25:07:13,872 --> 25:07:17,760
so on the screen here of course is a lot

39373
25:07:15,440 --> 25:07:20,440
of zeros and ones and suffice it to say

39374
25:07:17,760 --> 25:07:22,000
let me sum up the past nine weeks with

39375
25:07:20,440 --> 25:07:23,680
this is what's going on underneath the

39376
25:07:22,000 --> 25:07:25,192
hood but of course today we thought we'd

39377
25:07:23,680 --> 25:07:27,079
make things a little more accessible a

39378
25:07:25,192 --> 25:07:29,280
little more broadly applicable and

39379
25:07:27,080 --> 25:07:31,400
indeed our Focus today will not be on

39380
25:07:29,280 --> 25:07:33,512
what these patterns of zeros and ones

39381
25:07:31,400 --> 25:07:35,599
represent which in astute eye might

39382
25:07:33,512 --> 25:07:37,512
notice are replicated visually with

39383
25:07:35,600 --> 25:07:39,960
these light bulbs being in a pattern on

39384
25:07:37,512 --> 25:07:42,192
and off and as your child might have

39385
25:07:39,960 --> 25:07:44,480
hinted uh before class or perhaps now

39386
25:07:42,192 --> 25:07:46,080
this might very well spell a word up to

39387
25:07:44,480 --> 25:07:48,192
eight characters long because you can

39388
25:07:46,080 --> 25:07:50,040
encode even in the real world things

39389
25:07:48,192 --> 25:07:51,871
digital too but today we'll focus on

39390
25:07:50,040 --> 25:07:54,159
things much more high level this notion

39391
25:07:51,872 --> 25:07:58,000
of cyber security like our the security

39392
25:07:54,160 --> 25:07:59,872
of our data our privacy of our systems

39393
25:07:58,000 --> 25:08:01,192
particularly on the internet nowadays

39394
25:07:59,872 --> 25:08:02,640
because presumably all of us are

39395
25:08:01,192 --> 25:08:04,360
carrying Technologies around in our

39396
25:08:02,640 --> 25:08:07,720
pocket using laptops and desktops every

39397
25:08:04,360 --> 25:08:09,512
day and so the goal today is to

39398
25:08:07,720 --> 25:08:11,320
stipulate that this is what's going on

39399
25:08:09,512 --> 25:08:12,832
underneath the hood but let's solve some

39400
25:08:11,320 --> 25:08:14,680
problems at a higher level so that your

39401
25:08:12,832 --> 25:08:16,760
homework when you go back to wherever

39402
25:08:14,680 --> 25:08:19,079
you're visiting from can actually be to

39403
25:08:16,760 --> 25:08:21,720
apply some of today's Lessons Learned so

39404
25:08:19,080 --> 25:08:24,680
with that said perhaps the most common

39405
25:08:21,720 --> 25:08:26,512
familiar defense uh of one's systems and

39406
25:08:24,680 --> 25:08:28,159
data phone and laptops and desktops

39407
25:08:26,512 --> 25:08:30,120
would just be these simple passwords

39408
25:08:28,160 --> 25:08:32,600
unfortunately you and I are frankly as

39409
25:08:30,120 --> 25:08:34,231
humans not all that good at choosing

39410
25:08:32,600 --> 25:08:36,080
passwords and this is in itself a

39411
25:08:34,232 --> 25:08:39,480
relatively weak form of Defense even

39412
25:08:36,080 --> 25:08:41,552
though each of us has dozens hundreds of

39413
25:08:39,480 --> 25:08:46,040
passwords nowadays or at least dozens or

39414
25:08:41,552 --> 25:08:48,280
hundreds of accounts Maybe fives or tens

39415
25:08:46,040 --> 25:08:50,000
of dozens of passwords indeed if you're

39416
25:08:48,280 --> 25:08:52,280
in the habit of reusing passwords we'll

39417
25:08:50,000 --> 25:08:54,400
see today probably among our first

39418
25:08:52,280 --> 25:08:57,080
Lessons Learned so for instance if we

39419
25:08:54,400 --> 25:08:59,159
look back at the past year 2021 thanks

39420
25:08:57,080 --> 25:09:01,400
to security researchers who take a look

39421
25:08:59,160 --> 25:09:04,080
at data that has been hacked or leaked

39422
25:09:01,400 --> 25:09:06,192
online by way of public databases we

39423
25:09:04,080 --> 25:09:08,832
have a sense as computer scientists of

39424
25:09:06,192 --> 25:09:10,640
what the most popular or equivalently

39425
25:09:08,832 --> 25:09:11,871
what some of the worst passwords are

39426
25:09:10,640 --> 25:09:13,800
that you and I are choosing for our

39427
25:09:11,872 --> 25:09:16,320
system so as of this past year according

39428
25:09:13,800 --> 25:09:19,600
to one measure the most commonly used

39429
25:09:16,320 --> 25:09:23,720
password in systems everywhere was 1 2 3

39430
25:09:19,600 --> 25:09:25,760
4 5 6 all right number two password in

39431
25:09:23,720 --> 25:09:29,832
our top 10 here list was only slightly

39432
25:09:25,760 --> 25:09:32,120
longer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 after that we

39433
25:09:29,832 --> 25:09:35,040
took a turn in the other direction 1 2 3

39434
25:09:32,120 --> 25:09:37,360
4 five alone after that got a little

39435
25:09:35,040 --> 25:09:38,959
more interesting quiry which might sound

39436
25:09:37,360 --> 25:09:40,832
pretty cryptic but not if you look down

39437
25:09:38,960 --> 25:09:43,440
at your US keyboard and it's the top

39438
25:09:40,832 --> 25:09:46,480
leftand row of the keys on a an American

39439
25:09:43,440 --> 25:09:49,120
keyboard so also not all that hard uh

39440
25:09:46,480 --> 25:09:52,440
perhaps not surprisingly uh a little

39441
25:09:49,120 --> 25:09:54,959
disconcertingly number five was

39442
25:09:52,440 --> 25:09:58,160
password meanwhile number six returns us

39443
25:09:54,960 --> 25:10:02,120
to digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 after that

39444
25:09:58,160 --> 25:10:04,040
really less effort 111 111 uh after that

39445
25:10:02,120 --> 25:10:06,480
a little more variation but not all that

39446
25:10:04,040 --> 25:10:08,231
much 1 two 3 one two 3 after that it's

39447
25:10:06,480 --> 25:10:09,120
getting even less interesting 1 2 3 4 5

39448
25:10:08,232 --> 25:10:11,872
6 7

39449
25:10:09,120 --> 25:10:15,000
890 and then lastly topping the list is

39450
25:10:11,872 --> 25:10:17,160
just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so this is not a good

39451
25:10:15,000 --> 25:10:18,832
top 10 list to be on so among today's

39452
25:10:17,160 --> 25:10:21,000
first takeaways is if you see your

39453
25:10:18,832 --> 25:10:23,159
password on the screen like you didn't

39454
25:10:21,000 --> 25:10:25,080
make the list in a good way this means

39455
25:10:23,160 --> 25:10:27,080
hundreds thousands millions of other

39456
25:10:25,080 --> 25:10:29,360
people probably have that password of

39457
25:10:27,080 --> 25:10:31,192
yours now in of itself that's not

39458
25:10:29,360 --> 25:10:33,192
necessarily worrisome because I don't

39459
25:10:31,192 --> 25:10:35,280
know who has these passwords in a room

39460
25:10:33,192 --> 25:10:39,280
as large as this but just intuitively

39461
25:10:35,280 --> 25:10:42,552
why is this a bad thing either parent or

39462
25:10:39,280 --> 25:10:44,440
child welcome to raise a hand here why

39463
25:10:42,552 --> 25:10:47,552
might this be

39464
25:10:44,440 --> 25:10:49,232
intuitively yeah access to it so access

39465
25:10:47,552 --> 25:10:51,000
to it like I mean we literally as

39466
25:10:49,232 --> 25:10:53,320
computer scientists now have a database

39467
25:10:51,000 --> 25:10:55,960
of really common passwords and your your

39468
25:10:53,320 --> 25:10:57,872
thoughts password and can just find it

39469
25:10:55,960 --> 25:10:59,960
out quickly yeah you can just find it

39470
25:10:57,872 --> 25:11:01,440
out quickly I mean you could imagine

39471
25:10:59,960 --> 25:11:03,040
trying to guess someone's password by

39472
25:11:01,440 --> 25:11:05,080
just typing in random letters random

39473
25:11:03,040 --> 25:11:07,511
numbers random words but not if you have

39474
25:11:05,080 --> 25:11:09,080
a top 10 list like the the adversaries

39475
25:11:07,512 --> 25:11:11,080
in the world might as well just start

39476
25:11:09,080 --> 25:11:12,552
with this list now you'll notice that

39477
25:11:11,080 --> 25:11:13,832
even absent from this are slight

39478
25:11:12,552 --> 25:11:15,231
variants like some of you might be

39479
25:11:13,832 --> 25:11:16,799
thinking I'm not on the list cuz I do

39480
25:11:15,232 --> 25:11:19,480
something clever like I use an

39481
25:11:16,800 --> 25:11:23,360
exclamation point for the number one or

39482
25:11:19,480 --> 25:11:24,832
a three for an e or a five for an S and

39483
25:11:23,360 --> 25:11:26,800
based on the smiles in the room right

39484
25:11:24,832 --> 25:11:29,192
now you're not all that clever it turns

39485
25:11:26,800 --> 25:11:30,800
out because other people are smiling too

39486
25:11:29,192 --> 25:11:32,640
which is to say that an adversary can

39487
25:11:30,800 --> 25:11:34,552
take those same fistic that you might

39488
25:11:32,640 --> 25:11:36,232
think are making things more secure by

39489
25:11:34,552 --> 25:11:37,959
just tweaking some letters to numbers or

39490
25:11:36,232 --> 25:11:39,832
vice versa but if you're doing it and

39491
25:11:37,960 --> 25:11:41,800
other people are doing it the bad guys

39492
25:11:39,832 --> 25:11:43,799
so to speak are going to be doing it as

39493
25:11:41,800 --> 25:11:47,080
well so unfortunately when it comes to

39494
25:11:43,800 --> 25:11:48,640
passwords better is longer and random

39495
25:11:47,080 --> 25:11:50,280
and really unguessable but that's not

39496
25:11:48,640 --> 25:11:51,720
what most of us have in fact case in

39497
25:11:50,280 --> 25:11:53,720
point on our phones whether you have an

39498
25:11:51,720 --> 25:11:55,232
Android device or an iPhone nowadays you

39499
25:11:53,720 --> 25:11:57,120
know odds are you have something

39500
25:11:55,232 --> 25:11:58,552
relatively simplistic protecting it if

39501
25:11:57,120 --> 25:11:59,871
you have anything at all but at least

39502
25:11:58,552 --> 25:12:01,640
Apple and Google are pretty good at

39503
25:11:59,872 --> 25:12:03,600
least nudging us to choose these kinds

39504
25:12:01,640 --> 25:12:06,832
of passcodes now and a four-digit

39505
25:12:03,600 --> 25:12:08,360
passcode is quite common nowadays and so

39506
25:12:06,832 --> 25:12:10,832
here's where we have an opportunity

39507
25:12:08,360 --> 25:12:13,800
thanks to uh the URL that you saw on the

39508
25:12:10,832 --> 25:12:16,360
screen earlier to conjecture as a group

39509
25:12:13,800 --> 25:12:18,160
just how long might it take an adversary

39510
25:12:16,360 --> 25:12:20,552
someone out there who's out to get us or

39511
25:12:18,160 --> 25:12:23,960
get one of us uh how long might it take

39512
25:12:20,552 --> 25:12:26,640
an adversary to figure out your phone's

39513
25:12:23,960 --> 25:12:27,960
4digit passcode this is a cs50 is on

39514
25:12:26,640 --> 25:12:30,000
Carter Carter if we could switch over

39515
25:12:27,960 --> 25:12:31,720
and poll the audience here if you take

39516
25:12:30,000 --> 25:12:33,680
out your phone or laptop whatever device

39517
25:12:31,720 --> 25:12:38,232
you might have used a few minutes ago to

39518
25:12:33,680 --> 25:12:41,912
scan that QR code or to visit that same

39519
25:12:38,232 --> 25:12:43,960
URL you can see these questions on your

39520
25:12:41,912 --> 25:12:45,440
browser and if you can't that's fine

39521
25:12:43,960 --> 25:12:47,040
we'll share some aggregate data

39522
25:12:45,440 --> 25:12:48,800
nonetheless but you should have an

39523
25:12:47,040 --> 25:12:50,680
opportunity to tap one of your answers

39524
25:12:48,800 --> 25:12:54,192
and we'll give folks a few more

39525
25:12:50,680 --> 25:12:57,832
seconds if you'd like to play along at

39526
25:12:54,192 --> 25:13:00,120
home and here in just a

39527
25:12:57,832 --> 25:13:01,231
moment probably have many people

39528
25:13:00,120 --> 25:13:03,512
reporting but why don't we go ahead and

39529
25:13:01,232 --> 25:13:06,480
take a look at some percentages it looks

39530
25:13:03,512 --> 25:13:08,440
like most of you 67% are proposing just

39531
25:13:06,480 --> 25:13:10,512
a few seconds so that's not all that

39532
25:13:08,440 --> 25:13:11,832
good news if it's a four-digit passcode

39533
25:13:10,512 --> 25:13:14,120
some of you are hoping it's a few

39534
25:13:11,832 --> 25:13:16,832
minutes uh 8% are hoping a few hours

39535
25:13:14,120 --> 25:13:19,000
four more than 4% of you are really

39536
25:13:16,832 --> 25:13:20,439
hoping perhaps it's a few days well

39537
25:13:19,000 --> 25:13:21,960
let's actually consider how we can

39538
25:13:20,440 --> 25:13:23,080
answer this question and make today not

39539
25:13:21,960 --> 25:13:24,512
just conceptual but a little

39540
25:13:23,080 --> 25:13:26,080
quantitative too and see if we can't

39541
25:13:24,512 --> 25:13:27,720
slap some numbers on questions like

39542
25:13:26,080 --> 25:13:29,360
these so ultimately you can make more

39543
25:13:27,720 --> 25:13:31,280
informed decisions with your system

39544
25:13:29,360 --> 25:13:33,960
security so for instance when it comes

39545
25:13:31,280 --> 25:13:36,600
to four digigit passcodes rather than

39546
25:13:33,960 --> 25:13:38,232
just consider how secure it is well

39547
25:13:36,600 --> 25:13:39,720
let's make it a more precise question

39548
25:13:38,232 --> 25:13:41,360
like what are the forms of attack well

39549
25:13:39,720 --> 25:13:42,960
the simplest attack might be just

39550
25:13:41,360 --> 25:13:45,000
someone grabbing your phone be it in

39551
25:13:42,960 --> 25:13:46,760
your family or maybe at Starbucks or the

39552
25:13:45,000 --> 25:13:49,912
airport or the like and just starting

39553
25:13:46,760 --> 25:13:53,400
all possible combinations maybe 00000000

39554
25:13:49,912 --> 25:13:55,120
then 00001 and 00002 we could maybe

39555
25:13:53,400 --> 25:13:57,480
automate this a little bit so for

39556
25:13:55,120 --> 25:14:00,440
instance I might potentially be able to

39557
25:13:57,480 --> 25:14:02,120
do something like uh roboticize this

39558
25:14:00,440 --> 25:14:03,760
here let me go ahead and full screen a

39559
25:14:02,120 --> 25:14:05,640
quick video here that's just going to

39560
25:14:03,760 --> 25:14:08,040
paint a picture in just a moment on the

39561
25:14:05,640 --> 25:14:09,512
screen of how if we're a really clever

39562
25:14:08,040 --> 25:14:11,319
adversary and know how to build things

39563
25:14:09,512 --> 25:14:12,720
well at least maybe we could automate

39564
25:14:11,320 --> 25:14:15,120
some of that process so here's an

39565
25:14:12,720 --> 25:14:17,400
Android phone on a counter here's a very

39566
25:14:15,120 --> 25:14:19,680
simple tripod and a little touch device

39567
25:14:17,400 --> 25:14:22,511
robotically doing all of that hacking

39568
25:14:19,680 --> 25:14:25,192
for you starting at 0000 Z probably all

39569
25:14:22,512 --> 25:14:27,480
the way up to 9999 now that too wasn't

39570
25:14:25,192 --> 25:14:29,552
necessarily all of that all that fast

39571
25:14:27,480 --> 25:14:31,480
but at least you the adversary can step

39572
25:14:29,552 --> 25:14:33,680
away and doesn't actually have to be

39573
25:14:31,480 --> 25:14:35,400
bothered with the time involved the cost

39574
25:14:33,680 --> 25:14:37,120
involved in actually hacking that

39575
25:14:35,400 --> 25:14:39,799
particular device well let's go one

39576
25:14:37,120 --> 25:14:43,871
level deeper a little more interestingly

39577
25:14:39,800 --> 25:14:46,040
and consider here um the how much much

39578
25:14:43,872 --> 25:14:47,680
time really this so-called Brute Force

39579
25:14:46,040 --> 25:14:49,192
attack would take and that's actually a

39580
25:14:47,680 --> 25:14:50,439
term of art much like in yester year

39581
25:14:49,192 --> 25:14:52,360
when maybe there was a battering ram

39582
25:14:50,440 --> 25:14:54,280
trying to brute force their way into a

39583
25:14:52,360 --> 25:14:56,000
castle or something like that a Brute

39584
25:14:54,280 --> 25:14:58,720
Force attack digitally is just someone

39585
25:14:56,000 --> 25:15:00,680
trying manually all possible codes or

39586
25:14:58,720 --> 25:15:02,192
maybe robotically trying all possible

39587
25:15:00,680 --> 25:15:04,599
codes but generally automating the

39588
25:15:02,192 --> 25:15:07,192
process in some way to go through all

39589
25:15:04,600 --> 25:15:11,512
possibilities well if you've got for

39590
25:15:07,192 --> 25:15:13,040
instance um a 4digit passcode let's ask

39591
25:15:11,512 --> 25:15:16,720
maybe a follow-up question here not how

39592
25:15:13,040 --> 25:15:20,000
long will take but how many possible

39593
25:15:16,720 --> 25:15:21,720
4digit passcodes are there because then

39594
25:15:20,000 --> 25:15:24,280
maybe we can do some quick math and if

39595
25:15:21,720 --> 25:15:25,640
every passcode takes me a second or a

39596
25:15:24,280 --> 25:15:27,000
few milliseconds or the like then I

39597
25:15:25,640 --> 25:15:28,552
think we can try to extrapolate from

39598
25:15:27,000 --> 25:15:31,280
that whether the first answer was

39599
25:15:28,552 --> 25:15:33,599
seconds or minutes or days or hours or

39600
25:15:31,280 --> 25:15:35,319
something else so how many four-digit

39601
25:15:33,600 --> 25:15:36,680
passcodes are possible if you take out

39602
25:15:35,320 --> 25:15:38,600
your same device it should have just

39603
25:15:36,680 --> 25:15:40,319
changed automatically if it doesn't seem

39604
25:15:38,600 --> 25:15:43,040
to have maybe reload your browser with

39605
25:15:40,320 --> 25:15:45,232
some menu option and then tap in here

39606
25:15:43,040 --> 25:15:49,280
how many four digigit passcodes are

39607
25:15:45,232 --> 25:15:51,832
possible four total 40 99,999 10,000 or

39608
25:15:49,280 --> 25:15:54,160
unsure is okay

39609
25:15:51,832 --> 25:15:57,000
too so let's see we'll give you a few

39610
25:15:54,160 --> 25:15:59,360
more moments how many four digigit

39611
25:15:57,000 --> 25:16:03,480
passcodes are possible and shall we

39612
25:15:59,360 --> 25:16:06,160
reveal the results so now it looks like

39613
25:16:03,480 --> 25:16:10,552
uh a a few of you uh 2% of you are

39614
25:16:06,160 --> 25:16:12,280
saying just four passcodes 40 99,999

39615
25:16:10,552 --> 25:16:15,760
there's definitely some contention here

39616
25:16:12,280 --> 25:16:17,280
and 6% are un sure well how do we wrap

39617
25:16:15,760 --> 25:16:19,120
our minds around this well let's just

39618
25:16:17,280 --> 25:16:22,192
kind of do this real simply here let me

39619
25:16:19,120 --> 25:16:25,000
switch back over to doing a bit of math

39620
25:16:22,192 --> 25:16:27,000
and if we have here 10 possibilities for

39621
25:16:25,000 --> 25:16:29,280
each digit if there's four digits each

39622
25:16:27,000 --> 25:16:31,192
digit can be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine so

39623
25:16:29,280 --> 25:16:33,800
that's 10 possibilities so if you think

39624
25:16:31,192 --> 25:16:35,720
about the number of permutations that's

39625
25:16:33,800 --> 25:16:37,760
10 possibilities for the first digit

39626
25:16:35,720 --> 25:16:39,680
times 10 for the next time 10 to the for

39627
25:16:37,760 --> 25:16:42,319
the next times 10 for the next and so if

39628
25:16:39,680 --> 25:16:45,480
we do that out 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 or 10

39629
25:16:42,320 --> 25:16:48,680
the 4th there are indeed as 66% of you

39630
25:16:45,480 --> 25:16:50,231
uh found uh 10,000 possibilities and so

39631
25:16:48,680 --> 25:16:51,912
now we can kind of work backwards and

39632
25:16:50,232 --> 25:16:54,000
decide how long is it going to take for

39633
25:16:51,912 --> 25:16:56,360
an adversary to hack into this phone

39634
25:16:54,000 --> 25:16:58,120
because if it's one attack one guess per

39635
25:16:56,360 --> 25:17:00,440
second well that's going to map out to

39636
25:16:58,120 --> 25:17:02,640
10,000 seconds but maybe not if the

39637
25:17:00,440 --> 25:17:04,192
adversary isn't a roboticist or a human

39638
25:17:02,640 --> 25:17:06,319
what if they're like at a software

39639
25:17:04,192 --> 25:17:08,599
programmer someone who's taken even a

39640
25:17:06,320 --> 25:17:10,320
class introductory like cs50 and learned

39641
25:17:08,600 --> 25:17:11,832
a little bit of programming well a

39642
25:17:10,320 --> 25:17:14,320
little bit frighteningly it's not all

39643
25:17:11,832 --> 25:17:16,192
that hard to hack into systems if you

39644
25:17:14,320 --> 25:17:18,320
just know how to code to and really have

39645
25:17:16,192 --> 25:17:20,000
the computer do your work for you so in

39646
25:17:18,320 --> 25:17:22,040
fact let me go ahead and change over to

39647
25:17:20,000 --> 25:17:23,552
another screen on my computer here um

39648
25:17:22,040 --> 25:17:25,192
this is different for students in the

39649
25:17:23,552 --> 25:17:26,720
group from vs code this is just a black

39650
25:17:25,192 --> 25:17:28,280
and white version of it that we've used

39651
25:17:26,720 --> 25:17:30,120
briefly in the past and I'm just going

39652
25:17:28,280 --> 25:17:32,512
to go ahead and create a program called

39653
25:17:30,120 --> 25:17:34,231
crack.pie to crack something just

39654
25:17:32,512 --> 25:17:36,600
technically means to figure out what it

39655
25:17:34,232 --> 25:17:38,440
is figure out a password in this case

39656
25:17:36,600 --> 25:17:39,800
and dop means I'm going to use a

39657
25:17:38,440 --> 25:17:41,720
programming language that we here in

39658
25:17:39,800 --> 25:17:43,480
cs50 have been dabbling in in the past

39659
25:17:41,720 --> 25:17:46,000
couple of weeks with more to come next

39660
25:17:43,480 --> 25:17:47,480
week as well so it turns out and you

39661
25:17:46,000 --> 25:17:50,600
need not understand each of these lines

39662
25:17:47,480 --> 25:17:53,832
of code if I want to try maybe

39663
25:17:50,600 --> 25:17:55,232
generating all 10,000 possible codes I'm

39664
25:17:53,832 --> 25:17:56,832
not going to bother with a robot I've

39665
25:17:55,232 --> 25:17:58,512
got all these cables coming out of my

39666
25:17:56,832 --> 25:18:01,080
computer and odds are one of them is a

39667
25:17:58,512 --> 25:18:02,440
USB cable or a lightning cable surely we

39668
25:18:01,080 --> 25:18:04,720
could figure out how to connect like

39669
25:18:02,440 --> 25:18:06,552
laptop or desktop to phone and just like

39670
25:18:04,720 --> 25:18:08,192
automate the process nowadays by just

39671
25:18:06,552 --> 25:18:10,599
sending all of the numbers into the

39672
25:18:08,192 --> 25:18:12,799
phone until one uh unlocks the trick

39673
25:18:10,600 --> 25:18:14,552
just like in the movies or TV well in

39674
25:18:12,800 --> 25:18:17,040
Python I could write a program that does

39675
25:18:14,552 --> 25:18:19,599
this as follows I can import so to speak

39676
25:18:17,040 --> 25:18:21,079
all of the decimal digits 0 through n

39677
25:18:19,600 --> 25:18:23,440
and this for students in the room is

39678
25:18:21,080 --> 25:18:26,040
just a slightly better version of typing

39679
25:18:23,440 --> 25:18:28,600
out 10 different numbers manually I can

39680
25:18:26,040 --> 25:18:30,760
also import from a library so to speak

39681
25:18:28,600 --> 25:18:32,120
called iter tools for iteration tools

39682
25:18:30,760 --> 25:18:35,511
which means to do something again and

39683
25:18:32,120 --> 25:18:37,280
again I can import a function called

39684
25:18:35,512 --> 25:18:39,192
Product which means the cross product

39685
25:18:37,280 --> 25:18:40,959
like combine this with this some number

39686
25:18:39,192 --> 25:18:42,512
of times and then it's just two more

39687
25:18:40,960 --> 25:18:44,680
lines of code I can use what's called a

39688
25:18:42,512 --> 25:18:47,760
loop and programming so for every

39689
25:18:44,680 --> 25:18:51,719
passcode in the cross product of all 10

39690
25:18:47,760 --> 25:18:54,400
of those digits repeated a total of four

39691
25:18:51,720 --> 25:18:55,872
times let me go ahead and rather than

39692
25:18:54,400 --> 25:18:57,912
bother connecting my phone and hacking

39693
25:18:55,872 --> 25:18:59,680
my own phone let me just print out every

39694
25:18:57,912 --> 25:19:01,440
one of those 10,000 codes on the screen

39695
25:18:59,680 --> 25:19:03,079
and we'll see how fast the hacker could

39696
25:19:01,440 --> 25:19:04,640
do this let me go ahead and print and

39697
25:19:03,080 --> 25:19:06,480
with an asterisk which is a little trick

39698
25:19:04,640 --> 25:19:08,192
to format it nicely I'm going to print

39699
25:19:06,480 --> 25:19:10,760
out each of those passcodes and that's

39700
25:19:08,192 --> 25:19:12,640
it four lines of code maybe 40 seconds

39701
25:19:10,760 --> 25:19:14,640
of talking but maybe really four seconds

39702
25:19:12,640 --> 25:19:16,552
of code if I actually did this without

39703
25:19:14,640 --> 25:19:18,760
the audience and now let me go ahead and

39704
25:19:16,552 --> 25:19:21,192
save the file and I'm going to run as we

39705
25:19:18,760 --> 25:19:23,680
do every in class of late python of

39706
25:19:21,192 --> 25:19:25,319
crack.pie and when I hit enter I should

39707
25:19:23,680 --> 25:19:28,439
see on the screen all 10,000

39708
25:19:25,320 --> 25:19:30,400
possibilities from 000000 to 9999 so

39709
25:19:28,440 --> 25:19:35,232
let's see is it a few seconds minutes

39710
25:19:30,400 --> 25:19:37,360
hours or days done so barely even

39711
25:19:35,232 --> 25:19:38,872
seconds plural if that so that should be

39712
25:19:37,360 --> 25:19:40,440
a little disconcerting because all that

39713
25:19:38,872 --> 25:19:42,192
adversary needs to do is grab your phone

39714
25:19:40,440 --> 25:19:44,360
off the counter plug in a cable and boom

39715
25:19:42,192 --> 25:19:46,799
they're done like there's no ticking

39716
25:19:44,360 --> 25:19:48,000
clock or worries as in the movies or TV

39717
25:19:46,800 --> 25:19:49,960
that maybe you're going to come into the

39718
25:19:48,000 --> 25:19:52,400
room you don't need that much of a

39719
25:19:49,960 --> 25:19:55,000
window of time so what would be better

39720
25:19:52,400 --> 25:19:56,799
than this well let's consider what our

39721
25:19:55,000 --> 25:19:58,800
options might be if we don't want to

39722
25:19:56,800 --> 25:20:00,600
just use four-digit passcode some of you

39723
25:19:58,800 --> 25:20:02,680
indeed might have better passcodes than

39724
25:20:00,600 --> 25:20:05,320
that and maybe you use four letter

39725
25:20:02,680 --> 25:20:07,480
passcodes instead so A through Z maybe

39726
25:20:05,320 --> 25:20:09,360
uppercase and lowercase that starts to

39727
25:20:07,480 --> 25:20:11,400
make things a little more interesting so

39728
25:20:09,360 --> 25:20:13,832
should we pull this question too if we

39729
25:20:11,400 --> 25:20:15,959
upgrade from four digits to just four

39730
25:20:13,832 --> 25:20:17,720
letters English letters a through z

39731
25:20:15,960 --> 25:20:19,800
uppercase and lowercase why don't we go

39732
25:20:17,720 --> 25:20:25,000
ahead and pull the grip here and ask how

39733
25:20:19,800 --> 25:20:28,000
many four letter passcodes are there

39734
25:20:25,000 --> 25:20:30,080
instead so this time the range starts at

39735
25:20:28,000 --> 25:20:33,232
four still not the right answer though

39736
25:20:30,080 --> 25:20:35,680
this time how many four-letter passcodes

39737
25:20:33,232 --> 25:20:35,680
are

39738
25:20:35,872 --> 25:20:41,960
possible not just just take a couple

39739
25:20:39,680 --> 25:20:44,640
more

39740
25:20:41,960 --> 25:20:47,080
seconds

39741
25:20:44,640 --> 25:20:51,120
all right almost a couple hundred

39742
25:20:47,080 --> 25:20:51,120
responses in already few more

39743
25:20:52,320 --> 25:20:57,360
seconds

39744
25:20:54,360 --> 25:20:59,960
and why don't we go ahead and reveal now

39745
25:20:57,360 --> 25:21:02,480
the answers which are Okay so we've

39746
25:20:59,960 --> 25:21:04,760
solved a couple problems at least so we

39747
25:21:02,480 --> 25:21:06,680
well we well okay someone's just messing

39748
25:21:04,760 --> 25:21:09,360
with us now all right so it looks like

39749
25:21:06,680 --> 25:21:11,912
most of you 76% of you have claimed it's

39750
25:21:09,360 --> 25:21:13,600
7 million plus possibilities so that's

39751
25:21:11,912 --> 25:21:15,480
encouraging cuz that's a whole order of

39752
25:21:13,600 --> 25:21:16,640
magnitude more than before well let's

39753
25:21:15,480 --> 25:21:18,680
figure out how we might do this

39754
25:21:16,640 --> 25:21:20,912
mathematically so if we've got 26

39755
25:21:18,680 --> 25:21:22,480
lowercase 26 uppercase that's 52

39756
25:21:20,912 --> 25:21:25,080
possibilities now for each of those four

39757
25:21:22,480 --> 25:21:27,440
digits so that's 52 times itself four

39758
25:21:25,080 --> 25:21:29,360
times which indeed either off the top of

39759
25:21:27,440 --> 25:21:31,120
your head a good guess a calculator on

39760
25:21:29,360 --> 25:21:34,120
the same device you're using right now

39761
25:21:31,120 --> 25:21:36,319
indeed gives us 7 million instead well

39762
25:21:34,120 --> 25:21:38,159
what might be slightly better than that

39763
25:21:36,320 --> 25:21:40,000
well maybe four characters and this

39764
25:21:38,160 --> 25:21:41,832
indeed is what your Macs PCS and phones

39765
25:21:40,000 --> 25:21:43,872
are urging us to do nowadays not just

39766
25:21:41,832 --> 25:21:46,400
numbers not just letters but like really

39767
25:21:43,872 --> 25:21:48,360
annoying punctuation so it really looks

39768
25:21:46,400 --> 25:21:50,231
cryptic not just to the adversary but

39769
25:21:48,360 --> 25:21:52,360
also to you and me unfortunately and

39770
25:21:50,232 --> 25:21:54,400
that's the downside but here now we have

39771
25:21:52,360 --> 25:21:56,232
a mental model and really a

39772
25:21:54,400 --> 25:21:58,000
computational framework via which we can

39773
25:21:56,232 --> 25:22:00,120
evaluate the security of these and I'll

39774
25:21:58,000 --> 25:22:02,832
go ahead and spoil some of the math here

39775
25:22:00,120 --> 25:22:04,599
if we've got 52 uh letters of the

39776
25:22:02,832 --> 25:22:06,159
alphabet uppercase and lowercase 10

39777
25:22:04,600 --> 25:22:09,040
digits and if I count them out on my

39778
25:22:06,160 --> 25:22:10,872
keyboard about 32 punctuation symbols in

39779
25:22:09,040 --> 25:22:13,912
typical English grammar that actually

39780
25:22:10,872 --> 25:22:17,720
gives us 94 possibilities now which is

39781
25:22:13,912 --> 25:22:19,440
up from 52 which is up from 10 so now

39782
25:22:17,720 --> 25:22:21,800
we're really moving and now that would

39783
25:22:19,440 --> 25:22:23,720
give us 78 million possibility so

39784
25:22:21,800 --> 25:22:25,680
another order of magnitude now it's

39785
25:22:23,720 --> 25:22:26,912
still going to be relatively fast

39786
25:22:25,680 --> 25:22:29,319
because you know what I can actually do

39787
25:22:26,912 --> 25:22:32,080
this let me go back into my code here

39788
25:22:29,320 --> 25:22:33,832
let me reopen the same program and I can

39789
25:22:32,080 --> 25:22:35,800
point out just how easy it is to make

39790
25:22:33,832 --> 25:22:38,799
these changes instead of importing

39791
25:22:35,800 --> 25:22:40,800
digits as before I can import as your uh

39792
25:22:38,800 --> 25:22:43,120
child might know asky letters which are

39793
25:22:40,800 --> 25:22:46,552
a through z uppercase lowercase and I

39794
25:22:43,120 --> 25:22:48,192
can just change this here asky letters

39795
25:22:46,552 --> 25:22:49,800
and so this was that first version where

39796
25:22:48,192 --> 25:22:51,552
we just changed to letters let me now

39797
25:22:49,800 --> 25:22:53,640
rerun the code and instead of seeing

39798
25:22:51,552 --> 25:22:55,440
numbers we'll see letters flying across

39799
25:22:53,640 --> 25:22:57,720
the screen and if I walk over here to

39800
25:22:55,440 --> 25:22:59,640
the screen we'll see that by the time I

39801
25:22:57,720 --> 25:23:01,872
get here we're halfway through the

39802
25:22:59,640 --> 25:23:03,680
entire alphabet lowercase if I now start

39803
25:23:01,872 --> 25:23:06,000
walking away I think yep we're already

39804
25:23:03,680 --> 25:23:08,359
done now with uppercase as well if I

39805
25:23:06,000 --> 25:23:10,280
upgrade this slightly further let's go

39806
25:23:08,360 --> 25:23:13,960
ahead and take it one more level and

39807
25:23:10,280 --> 25:23:16,600
perhaps do let's say ask letters and

39808
25:23:13,960 --> 25:23:18,800
digits and punctuation and this would be

39809
25:23:16,600 --> 25:23:21,040
the pythonic way to say that and I'm

39810
25:23:18,800 --> 25:23:23,912
going to add to those letters those same

39811
25:23:21,040 --> 25:23:25,400
digits those same punctuation symbols

39812
25:23:23,912 --> 25:23:27,599
let me shrink my font just so the code

39813
25:23:25,400 --> 25:23:30,280
still fits on the screen and what we now

39814
25:23:27,600 --> 25:23:33,360
have is with a two seconds of changes a

39815
25:23:30,280 --> 25:23:36,120
program that if I run this version

39816
25:23:33,360 --> 25:23:39,000
whoops without the typographical error

39817
25:23:36,120 --> 25:23:41,599
this is what we call in cs50 a bug so

39818
25:23:39,000 --> 25:23:44,232
now we run the same this is what we call

39819
25:23:41,600 --> 25:23:46,872
in cs50 a second

39820
25:23:44,232 --> 25:23:49,480
bug

39821
25:23:46,872 --> 25:23:51,080
punctuation okay this is where I cross

39822
25:23:49,480 --> 25:23:52,832
my fingers okay so now it's going to be

39823
25:23:51,080 --> 25:23:54,480
a little hard to see as it flies across

39824
25:23:52,832 --> 25:23:56,319
the screen but you probably are seeing

39825
25:23:54,480 --> 25:23:58,120
glimpses of some weird punctuation

39826
25:23:56,320 --> 25:24:00,160
characters as well and I won't waste our

39827
25:23:58,120 --> 25:24:01,912
time trying to talk through this because

39828
25:24:00,160 --> 25:24:03,512
this is going to take longer we're still

39829
25:24:01,912 --> 25:24:06,440
in the lower case I'm still over here

39830
25:24:03,512 --> 25:24:08,912
already we've not even gotten to n now O

39831
25:24:06,440 --> 25:24:11,232
then P so this is going to run longer

39832
25:24:08,912 --> 25:24:12,800
but let's end with one final question on

39833
25:24:11,232 --> 25:24:14,800
the security of all these systems I'm

39834
25:24:12,800 --> 25:24:16,512
going to cancel that by hitting contrl C

39835
25:24:14,800 --> 25:24:19,000
on my keyboard and let's ask the

39836
25:24:16,512 --> 25:24:20,832
question instead if we use eight

39837
25:24:19,000 --> 25:24:23,232
character passwords so twice as many

39838
25:24:20,832 --> 25:24:24,959
characters but even that is not terribly

39839
25:24:23,232 --> 25:24:26,640
long right this is eight characters

39840
25:24:24,960 --> 25:24:28,552
alone on the stage eight characters

39841
25:24:26,640 --> 25:24:30,360
using letters numbers and punctuation

39842
25:24:28,552 --> 25:24:33,120
might be better let's do one final vote

39843
25:24:30,360 --> 25:24:36,000
here if we could on your same device how

39844
25:24:33,120 --> 25:24:38,040
many eight character possibilities are

39845
25:24:36,000 --> 25:24:40,000
there now

39846
25:24:38,040 --> 25:24:42,400
for these

39847
25:24:40,000 --> 25:24:44,120
passcodes and now for didn't even make

39848
25:24:42,400 --> 25:24:46,871
the list this

39849
25:24:44,120 --> 25:24:48,760
time all right few more seconds about

39850
25:24:46,872 --> 25:24:51,320
100 responses so

39851
25:24:48,760 --> 25:24:52,640
far how about we go ahead and Carter if

39852
25:24:51,320 --> 25:24:55,192
you would't mind let's reveal the

39853
25:24:52,640 --> 25:24:56,600
results based on the vote a pretty

39854
25:24:55,192 --> 25:24:58,599
decent spread here although the

39855
25:24:56,600 --> 25:25:00,320
quadrillions are quickly buzzing in and

39856
25:24:58,600 --> 25:25:02,872
they're contending with the others here

39857
25:25:00,320 --> 25:25:05,720
looks like 44% of you said quintilian

39858
25:25:02,872 --> 25:25:08,600
34% said quadrillion and this time for

39859
25:25:05,720 --> 25:25:11,120
the first time uh you overbid so indeed

39860
25:25:08,600 --> 25:25:13,040
if we go back to the math here at least

39861
25:25:11,120 --> 25:25:15,720
the majority overbid if we have eight

39862
25:25:13,040 --> 25:25:18,360
character passcodes that gives us 94

39863
25:25:15,720 --> 25:25:20,552
times itself 8 times or 94 to the eth

39864
25:25:18,360 --> 25:25:26,080
power and in fact that gives us roughly

39865
25:25:20,552 --> 25:25:28,599
6 quadrillion 95 trillion 689 Bill 385

39866
25:25:26,080 --> 25:25:31,680
mil 410,000 and

39867
25:25:28,600 --> 25:25:34,320
86 possible passcodes now what does that

39868
25:25:31,680 --> 25:25:36,680
mean well the adversary's algorithm the

39869
25:25:34,320 --> 25:25:38,800
step-by-step code that they write to try

39870
25:25:36,680 --> 25:25:40,912
to hack into your phone is no different

39871
25:25:38,800 --> 25:25:43,832
and honestly if your passcode is eight

39872
25:25:40,912 --> 25:25:45,872
characters long but there're zeros

39873
25:25:43,832 --> 25:25:47,511
00000000000000 you're no more secure

39874
25:25:45,872 --> 25:25:49,320
fundamentally you really want to be

39875
25:25:47,512 --> 25:25:51,232
somewhere in The Sweet Spot of that

39876
25:25:49,320 --> 25:25:53,040
massive range of values so that if the

39877
25:25:51,232 --> 25:25:55,000
adversary tries this Brute Force attack

39878
25:25:53,040 --> 25:25:58,360
just running through all possibilities

39879
25:25:55,000 --> 25:26:00,680
they will eventually reach your passcode

39880
25:25:58,360 --> 25:26:02,160
just mathematically it will be there

39881
25:26:00,680 --> 25:26:04,159
hopefully though well maybe not

39882
25:26:02,160 --> 25:26:06,600
hopefully you and I and they will be

39883
25:26:04,160 --> 25:26:08,720
gone from this world because that much

39884
25:26:06,600 --> 25:26:11,040
time will have passed and if we fact if

39885
25:26:08,720 --> 25:26:14,160
we do out the math here uh this number

39886
25:26:11,040 --> 25:26:16,912
of seconds for instance is long past uh

39887
25:26:14,160 --> 25:26:18,480
when uh uh we will uh no longer be here

39888
25:26:16,912 --> 25:26:20,000
so that's the sort of measure is we

39889
25:26:18,480 --> 25:26:21,912
don't sort of fundamentally change the

39890
25:26:20,000 --> 25:26:23,720
equation for the adversary it's still

39891
25:26:21,912 --> 25:26:25,360
the same risk it's still the same attack

39892
25:26:23,720 --> 25:26:27,872
but you significantly drive down the

39893
25:26:25,360 --> 25:26:30,120
probability of success on their part or

39894
25:26:27,872 --> 25:26:32,232
conceptually you drive up the cost to

39895
25:26:30,120 --> 25:26:34,440
the adversary and indeed even in the

39896
25:26:32,232 --> 25:26:36,440
physical world this is true you just

39897
25:26:34,440 --> 25:26:38,872
want your passcode in the digital world

39898
25:26:36,440 --> 25:26:40,640
really to be better than someone else's

39899
25:26:38,872 --> 25:26:42,000
because you want someone else's passcode

39900
25:26:40,640 --> 25:26:43,280
to be the one that the adversary does

39901
25:26:42,000 --> 25:26:45,440
something with with just like in the

39902
25:26:43,280 --> 25:26:47,512
physical world even though it's a bit uh

39903
25:26:45,440 --> 25:26:50,120
uncomfortable to consider your house

39904
25:26:47,512 --> 25:26:52,080
doesn't need to be 100% secure and

39905
25:26:50,120 --> 25:26:53,640
indeed it's difficult to make it such

39906
25:26:52,080 --> 25:26:55,552
there's always going to be a a point of

39907
25:26:53,640 --> 25:26:57,872
weakness maybe it's that window the door

39908
25:26:55,552 --> 25:26:59,552
or something like that but if your home

39909
25:26:57,872 --> 25:27:02,280
is more secure than the next door home

39910
25:26:59,552 --> 25:27:04,552
just probabilistically you are more

39911
25:27:02,280 --> 25:27:06,360
secure you're not secure and indeed any

39912
25:27:04,552 --> 25:27:08,440
website you see down the road that says

39913
25:27:06,360 --> 25:27:10,440
we are secure because we do X Y or Z

39914
25:27:08,440 --> 25:27:13,000
like that's nonsense security is really

39915
25:27:10,440 --> 25:27:15,552
about comparisons and Val ating things

39916
25:27:13,000 --> 25:27:18,120
if quantitatively relative to some other

39917
25:27:15,552 --> 25:27:20,040
system relative to some other code so

39918
25:27:18,120 --> 25:27:21,512
what's the takeaway here well hopefully

39919
25:27:20,040 --> 25:27:24,079
a non-trivial number of you we'll go

39920
25:27:21,512 --> 25:27:26,480
home this weekend on Monday and change

39921
25:27:24,080 --> 25:27:27,760
at least one passcode um but there's

39922
25:27:26,480 --> 25:27:29,832
going to be a trade-off here and we talk

39923
25:27:27,760 --> 25:27:32,832
about this all the time in cs50 anytime

39924
25:27:29,832 --> 25:27:34,720
we improve something we pay some price

39925
25:27:32,832 --> 25:27:36,480
in time and performance and cost

39926
25:27:34,720 --> 25:27:38,600
somewhere else so what's the downside

39927
25:27:36,480 --> 25:27:40,912
then of this advice that you should use

39928
25:27:38,600 --> 25:27:43,160
minimally eight character

39929
25:27:40,912 --> 25:27:44,872
passcodes why might you want to say nay

39930
25:27:43,160 --> 25:27:47,552
and not do

39931
25:27:44,872 --> 25:27:49,512
this say again you have to remember you

39932
25:27:47,552 --> 25:27:51,159
have to remember it right and so here

39933
25:27:49,512 --> 25:27:52,960
there's sort of some sociology there's

39934
25:27:51,160 --> 25:27:54,192
some human behavior you know some of you

39935
25:27:52,960 --> 25:27:55,600
might have colleagues if you're working

39936
25:27:54,192 --> 25:27:57,360
in the real world at least back in

39937
25:27:55,600 --> 25:27:58,832
healthier times when you had colleagues

39938
25:27:57,360 --> 25:28:00,080
with desks and cubicles and there's

39939
25:27:58,832 --> 25:28:02,080
probably one person in the office with

39940
25:28:00,080 --> 25:28:03,872
like a Post-It note on their monitor

39941
25:28:02,080 --> 25:28:07,232
with their passcode you know it's a bit

39942
25:28:03,872 --> 25:28:09,440
of a cyber security offense but it's

39943
25:28:07,232 --> 25:28:11,232
also a sort of real world side effect

39944
25:28:09,440 --> 25:28:14,000
maybe of corporate policies that aren't

39945
25:28:11,232 --> 25:28:15,600
really calibrated for human behavior so

39946
25:28:14,000 --> 25:28:17,360
we'll see if there's some other defenses

39947
25:28:15,600 --> 25:28:19,280
and indeed let me propose that we talk

39948
25:28:17,360 --> 25:28:21,120
briefly about one that actually tends to

39949
25:28:19,280 --> 25:28:22,832
kick in automatically even if your

39950
25:28:21,120 --> 25:28:24,799
passcode is not as strong as we've just

39951
25:28:22,832 --> 25:28:26,552
seen one of these six quadrillion

39952
25:28:24,800 --> 25:28:28,680
possibilities well what could we do

39953
25:28:26,552 --> 25:28:31,912
instead well as anyone and I'll zoom in

39954
25:28:28,680 --> 25:28:34,120
on this here accidentally locked themsel

39955
25:28:31,912 --> 25:28:36,512
out of their own phone before like when

39956
25:28:34,120 --> 25:28:38,599
does that happen yeah when you try the

39957
25:28:36,512 --> 25:28:40,760
password too many times yeah so too many

39958
25:28:38,600 --> 25:28:42,552
times maybe your finger's slightly off

39959
25:28:40,760 --> 25:28:45,120
maybe you're slightly off and you just

39960
25:28:42,552 --> 25:28:47,000
don't input the same passcode correctly

39961
25:28:45,120 --> 25:28:48,871
after like five times 10 times there's

39962
25:28:47,000 --> 25:28:50,832
some reasonable threshold and why does

39963
25:28:48,872 --> 25:28:52,600
that happen well Apple and Google

39964
25:28:50,832 --> 25:28:54,640
equivalently figure just

39965
25:28:52,600 --> 25:28:56,232
probabilistically if after 10 guesses

39966
25:28:54,640 --> 25:28:58,400
you still haven't typed in the right

39967
25:28:56,232 --> 25:28:59,872
passcode probably you're not you you're

39968
25:28:58,400 --> 25:29:01,192
someone else who's picked up your phone

39969
25:28:59,872 --> 25:29:03,280
so we're just going to go ahead and lock

39970
25:29:01,192 --> 25:29:05,040
you out now what's the effect of this

39971
25:29:03,280 --> 25:29:06,760
well this means now that each of those

39972
25:29:05,040 --> 25:29:09,480
possible passcodes no longer takes

39973
25:29:06,760 --> 25:29:11,439
roughly 1 second now it takes roughly 1

39974
25:29:09,480 --> 25:29:13,280
minute so the attack is still the same

39975
25:29:11,440 --> 25:29:16,000
but if it's now one passcode or 10

39976
25:29:13,280 --> 25:29:18,360
guesses per minute we have significantly

39977
25:29:16,000 --> 25:29:19,760
by a factor of 60 in this story slowed

39978
25:29:18,360 --> 25:29:21,360
things down and unfortunately does

39979
25:29:19,760 --> 25:29:23,439
anyone know what happens if you screw up

39980
25:29:21,360 --> 25:29:25,512
again after a

39981
25:29:23,440 --> 25:29:27,912
minute yeah it goes longer it's like

39982
25:29:25,512 --> 25:29:29,480
five minutes and then 10 minutes and uh

39983
25:29:27,912 --> 25:29:31,232
Google is kind of obnoxious about it

39984
25:29:29,480 --> 25:29:34,000
they don't even give you a time frame

39985
25:29:31,232 --> 25:29:36,192
they just say try again later and so

39986
25:29:34,000 --> 25:29:38,080
that keeps not only the adversary out

39987
25:29:36,192 --> 25:29:39,832
but also potentially you so there in

39988
25:29:38,080 --> 25:29:41,512
lies that trade-off if you've forgotten

39989
25:29:39,832 --> 25:29:43,120
your code if nowadays your finger is

39990
25:29:41,512 --> 25:29:45,120
slightly wet so the screen isn't

39991
25:29:43,120 --> 25:29:47,552
responding correctly these could be

39992
25:29:45,120 --> 25:29:49,959
usability downsides too so security is

39993
25:29:47,552 --> 25:29:52,552
really just about finding The Sweet Spot

39994
25:29:49,960 --> 25:29:54,232
among these various tradeoffs here but

39995
25:29:52,552 --> 25:29:56,480
there's other mechanisms too and some of

39996
25:29:54,232 --> 25:29:58,960
you might recognize this screen from

39997
25:29:56,480 --> 25:30:01,480
Gmail via which of course you log in but

39998
25:29:58,960 --> 25:30:04,080
after you log into Gmail or similar

39999
25:30:01,480 --> 25:30:06,000
websites or apps or systems at work

40000
25:30:04,080 --> 25:30:08,192
nowadays especially you might be

40001
25:30:06,000 --> 25:30:10,872
presented with uh what's called

40002
25:30:08,192 --> 25:30:12,871
two-factor authentication and what is

40003
25:30:10,872 --> 25:30:15,320
this in a nutshell in Lay person

40004
25:30:12,872 --> 25:30:17,232
terms most many of you if you do

40005
25:30:15,320 --> 25:30:19,440
anything digitally at work might have to

40006
25:30:17,232 --> 25:30:21,872
do this now

40007
25:30:19,440 --> 25:30:24,400
yeah exactly you get texted at your

40008
25:30:21,872 --> 25:30:26,232
phone an additional code that's not your

40009
25:30:24,400 --> 25:30:28,159
same password it's typically a numeric

40010
25:30:26,232 --> 25:30:30,080
code maybe six digits long it expires

40011
25:30:28,160 --> 25:30:32,760
after a minute or 10 minutes but why is

40012
25:30:30,080 --> 25:30:34,400
this a good thing well one it's no

40013
25:30:32,760 --> 25:30:36,319
longer just a piece of information that

40014
25:30:34,400 --> 25:30:38,832
you know or that you might have written

40015
25:30:36,320 --> 25:30:40,640
down it's information that changes every

40016
25:30:38,832 --> 25:30:42,552
time you try to log in but more

40017
25:30:40,640 --> 25:30:44,080
importantly it's a fundamentally second

40018
25:30:42,552 --> 25:30:45,552
factor which means it's not just

40019
25:30:44,080 --> 25:30:47,720
something you know now it's something

40020
25:30:45,552 --> 25:30:49,512
you have so you for instance are the

40021
25:30:47,720 --> 25:30:51,000
only one theoretically that should be

40022
25:30:49,512 --> 25:30:52,640
receiving that code and so now the

40023
25:30:51,000 --> 25:30:54,800
adversary if they want to get into your

40024
25:30:52,640 --> 25:30:56,800
account not only have to guess or brute

40025
25:30:54,800 --> 25:30:58,760
force or maybe read off of a Post-It

40026
25:30:56,800 --> 25:31:00,832
note your password they also have to

40027
25:30:58,760 --> 25:31:02,871
physically have access now to that phone

40028
25:31:00,832 --> 25:31:04,799
so there's still a threat absolutely but

40029
25:31:02,872 --> 25:31:06,912
it's not everyone on the internet with

40030
25:31:04,800 --> 25:31:08,640
an internet connection now it's only the

40031
25:31:06,912 --> 25:31:10,440
people in Starbucks now it's only the

40032
25:31:08,640 --> 25:31:12,600
people at work now it's only the people

40033
25:31:10,440 --> 25:31:14,160
in your home who might have access to

40034
25:31:12,600 --> 25:31:16,232
that second Factor so there too it just

40035
25:31:14,160 --> 25:31:17,832
raises the bar to the adversary making

40036
25:31:16,232 --> 25:31:19,552
it harder more timec consuming more

40037
25:31:17,832 --> 25:31:21,552
geographically impossible for them to

40038
25:31:19,552 --> 25:31:23,400
attack you but what's the downside of

40039
25:31:21,552 --> 25:31:26,512
two-factor authentication whether it's a

40040
25:31:23,400 --> 25:31:27,832
device or even nowadays it's in software

40041
25:31:26,512 --> 25:31:29,320
whether it's on your keychain or on your

40042
25:31:27,832 --> 25:31:31,400
phone where you're prompted for this

40043
25:31:29,320 --> 25:31:33,320
code what's a downside as some of us

40044
25:31:31,400 --> 25:31:36,511
have probably experienced

40045
25:31:33,320 --> 25:31:38,360
too forg you forget your cell phone

40046
25:31:36,512 --> 25:31:40,192
absolutely right the the factor that you

40047
25:31:38,360 --> 25:31:41,360
have you don't have with you or maybe

40048
25:31:40,192 --> 25:31:42,871
you're in a basement somewhere don't

40049
25:31:41,360 --> 25:31:45,192
have reception you're on a plane you

40050
25:31:42,872 --> 25:31:46,960
can't get the code and so there too are

40051
25:31:45,192 --> 25:31:48,319
these tradeoffs and even it departments

40052
25:31:46,960 --> 25:31:50,160
need to keep that in mind because what

40053
25:31:48,320 --> 25:31:51,720
does that mean for them well if you

40054
25:31:50,160 --> 25:31:53,480
don't have your phone with you and you

40055
25:31:51,720 --> 25:31:55,640
are in the habit of calling it to help

40056
25:31:53,480 --> 25:31:57,640
you fix this now there's a a cost a

40057
25:31:55,640 --> 25:32:00,160
human cost maybe even a financial cost

40058
25:31:57,640 --> 25:32:02,192
and so it policy nowadays is really just

40059
25:32:00,160 --> 25:32:03,912
about finding the right balance and

40060
25:32:02,192 --> 25:32:07,120
where we want to spend our resources but

40061
25:32:03,912 --> 25:32:09,760
at least raise the bar to the adversary

40062
25:32:07,120 --> 25:32:11,280
but of course there's other ways too and

40063
25:32:09,760 --> 25:32:12,959
this is going to be one of our homework

40064
25:32:11,280 --> 25:32:14,360
assignments if you will after today

40065
25:32:12,960 --> 25:32:16,600
there's this software called password

40066
25:32:14,360 --> 25:32:18,512
managers and no need to buzz in on your

40067
25:32:16,600 --> 25:32:22,512
phone but maybe with a physical hand how

40068
25:32:18,512 --> 25:32:25,120
many folks here use a password manager

40069
25:32:22,512 --> 25:32:27,120
okay let me ballpark this at 10 20%

40070
25:32:25,120 --> 25:32:29,159
perhaps Okay so we've got 80% upside

40071
25:32:27,120 --> 25:32:31,040
here and a lesson learned potentially so

40072
25:32:29,160 --> 25:32:32,872
a password manager is just a piece of

40073
25:32:31,040 --> 25:32:35,079
software on your Mac your PC or your

40074
25:32:32,872 --> 25:32:36,680
phone nowadays that manages your

40075
25:32:35,080 --> 25:32:38,440
passwords well what is that mean when

40076
25:32:36,680 --> 25:32:39,871
you go to a website for the first time

40077
25:32:38,440 --> 25:32:41,552
or you download an app for the first

40078
25:32:39,872 --> 25:32:43,480
time and you have to create an account

40079
25:32:41,552 --> 25:32:45,552
you can can still use your email address

40080
25:32:43,480 --> 25:32:46,959
or David as your username or whatever

40081
25:32:45,552 --> 25:32:49,080
your name might be so you don't have to

40082
25:32:46,960 --> 25:32:52,480
change that methodology but instead of

40083
25:32:49,080 --> 25:32:54,832
typing in one 2 3 4 5 six as your same

40084
25:32:52,480 --> 25:32:57,000
password for that website or app as well

40085
25:32:54,832 --> 25:32:59,231
as for every other now you use the

40086
25:32:57,000 --> 25:33:01,720
password manager software to generate

40087
25:32:59,232 --> 25:33:03,600
something difficult to guess for you

40088
25:33:01,720 --> 25:33:06,080
that is you tell the password manager

40089
25:33:03,600 --> 25:33:08,640
give me an8 character random passcode

40090
25:33:06,080 --> 25:33:10,800
not 0000 but something with punctuation

40091
25:33:08,640 --> 25:33:12,120
with numbers with letters and better yet

40092
25:33:10,800 --> 25:33:15,280
the password manager is the name

40093
25:33:12,120 --> 25:33:16,400
suggests remembers that password for you

40094
25:33:15,280 --> 25:33:17,512
and the next time you go to another

40095
25:33:16,400 --> 25:33:19,159
website you do it again with a

40096
25:33:17,512 --> 25:33:21,280
completely different password maybe same

40097
25:33:19,160 --> 25:33:22,800
username maybe two-factor authentication

40098
25:33:21,280 --> 25:33:24,319
but different password different

40099
25:33:22,800 --> 25:33:25,680
password different password and it

40100
25:33:24,320 --> 25:33:28,440
doesn't have to be eight I mean I'm in

40101
25:33:25,680 --> 25:33:30,120
the habit of using a dozen two dozen

40102
25:33:28,440 --> 25:33:31,872
characters in total and at that point I

40103
25:33:30,120 --> 25:33:33,799
can't even pronounce the number of

40104
25:33:31,872 --> 25:33:36,232
possibilities because it goes well be

40105
25:33:33,800 --> 25:33:37,640
Beyond uh the quadrillions so the

40106
25:33:36,232 --> 25:33:39,800
probability that someone's going to get

40107
25:33:37,640 --> 25:33:41,512
into one of those accounts for me now is

40108
25:33:39,800 --> 25:33:43,800
very very very low and they're going to

40109
25:33:41,512 --> 25:33:45,280
take less interest in me and maybe more

40110
25:33:43,800 --> 25:33:47,080
interest in someone else that's not

40111
25:33:45,280 --> 25:33:48,720
using as good of a password now what

40112
25:33:47,080 --> 25:33:51,552
does this mean in real terms well when

40113
25:33:48,720 --> 25:33:53,960
you go to log into that managed site you

40114
25:33:51,552 --> 25:33:55,720
don't manually type your password

40115
25:33:53,960 --> 25:33:57,280
anymore in fact you don't generally even

40116
25:33:55,720 --> 25:34:01,120
need to know it nowadays I probably

40117
25:33:57,280 --> 25:34:03,400
don't know 90 plus 99% of my passwords I

40118
25:34:01,120 --> 25:34:05,192
entrust them to this password manager

40119
25:34:03,400 --> 25:34:08,680
now of course you'd like to think that

40120
25:34:05,192 --> 25:34:10,192
the password manager itself is secure so

40121
25:34:08,680 --> 25:34:12,359
what might that mean well those of you

40122
25:34:10,192 --> 25:34:15,080
who do use a password manager how do you

40123
25:34:12,360 --> 25:34:17,600
access that software itself what's

40124
25:34:15,080 --> 25:34:19,832
protecting your data in your

40125
25:34:17,600 --> 25:34:21,512
understanding so maybe Biometrics like

40126
25:34:19,832 --> 25:34:23,231
your your face ID or maybe your

40127
25:34:21,512 --> 25:34:26,120
fingerprint or maybe more simply what

40128
25:34:23,232 --> 25:34:29,080
else password maybe just a password and

40129
25:34:26,120 --> 25:34:31,912
hopefully that password that primary

40130
25:34:29,080 --> 25:34:34,720
password that gatekeeper is not itself 1

40131
25:34:31,912 --> 25:34:36,959
2 3 4 5 6 otherwise it doesn't matter

40132
25:34:34,720 --> 25:34:38,640
how secure all of the others are but if

40133
25:34:36,960 --> 25:34:41,760
you're willing to put in the effort and

40134
25:34:38,640 --> 25:34:43,552
pick one pretty long somewhat random

40135
25:34:41,760 --> 25:34:45,552
very unguessable password that you just

40136
25:34:43,552 --> 25:34:47,120
promise to commit to memory and maybe

40137
25:34:45,552 --> 25:34:48,912
for backup you literally print it out

40138
25:34:47,120 --> 25:34:50,680
and put it in a safe deposit box or a

40139
25:34:48,912 --> 25:34:52,160
safe or just kind of hide it somewhere

40140
25:34:50,680 --> 25:34:53,511
physically that there's very low

40141
25:34:52,160 --> 25:34:55,960
probability someone's going to find the

40142
25:34:53,512 --> 25:34:58,040
backup copy that might be Al loan but of

40143
25:34:55,960 --> 25:35:00,000
course the flip side is now if you

40144
25:34:58,040 --> 25:35:02,079
forget that Ma that primary password

40145
25:35:00,000 --> 25:35:04,160
you've now lost all of the eggs in the

40146
25:35:02,080 --> 25:35:06,160
basket if someone gets that primary

40147
25:35:04,160 --> 25:35:07,832
password now they have access to

40148
25:35:06,160 --> 25:35:10,192
everything so that's rather the

40149
25:35:07,832 --> 25:35:12,599
trade-off but I dare say you're probably

40150
25:35:10,192 --> 25:35:14,799
less threatened depending on your family

40151
25:35:12,600 --> 25:35:17,192
uh uh by the people immediately around

40152
25:35:14,800 --> 25:35:18,720
you than the billions of other people on

40153
25:35:17,192 --> 25:35:20,912
the internet that have access

40154
25:35:18,720 --> 25:35:22,400
potentially to those same systems so

40155
25:35:20,912 --> 25:35:24,480
there to it's a trade-off and it's up to

40156
25:35:22,400 --> 25:35:26,231
you to decide whether or not to manage

40157
25:35:24,480 --> 25:35:28,040
your passwords in this way but if you

40158
25:35:26,232 --> 25:35:30,000
were on that top 10 list or even if

40159
25:35:28,040 --> 25:35:32,231
you're not but you can think of several

40160
25:35:30,000 --> 25:35:33,760
accounts that all have the same password

40161
25:35:32,232 --> 25:35:35,360
you're probably going to benefit from

40162
25:35:33,760 --> 25:35:38,280
something like this and why is it bad to

40163
25:35:35,360 --> 25:35:40,720
be clear to use the same password on

40164
25:35:38,280 --> 25:35:42,760
multiple sites in case that's never sort

40165
25:35:40,720 --> 25:35:45,280
of dawned

40166
25:35:42,760 --> 25:35:47,400
in thought why is that a bad thing to

40167
25:35:45,280 --> 25:35:51,640
reuse a password on different websites

40168
25:35:47,400 --> 25:35:51,640
different apps any intuition yeah and

40169
25:35:52,160 --> 25:35:57,280
back exactly once it's attacked you can

40170
25:35:55,280 --> 25:35:59,720
the adversary presumably by transitivity

40171
25:35:57,280 --> 25:36:01,680
can see oh well if this user's username

40172
25:35:59,720 --> 25:36:03,832
is mailin harvard.edu on this website

40173
25:36:01,680 --> 25:36:06,040
and their password is foolishly 1 2 3 4

40174
25:36:03,832 --> 25:36:07,832
56 or even something way more

40175
25:36:06,040 --> 25:36:09,400
complicated they can probably just

40176
25:36:07,832 --> 25:36:11,760
assume with high probability that if I'm

40177
25:36:09,400 --> 25:36:14,040
being a little reckless let's try access

40178
25:36:11,760 --> 25:36:16,159
mailin at harvard.edu other accounts

40179
25:36:14,040 --> 25:36:17,680
other apps using that exact same

40180
25:36:16,160 --> 25:36:19,480
password and so by transitivity

40181
25:36:17,680 --> 25:36:21,359
essentially you're putting your other uh

40182
25:36:19,480 --> 25:36:23,800
Accounts at risk so what's maybe a

40183
25:36:21,360 --> 25:36:25,280
takeaway minimally here I would start to

40184
25:36:23,800 --> 25:36:26,960
reconsider your passcodes on your most

40185
25:36:25,280 --> 25:36:28,600
important data Maybe it's medical maybe

40186
25:36:26,960 --> 25:36:30,232
it's Financial maybe it's email anything

40187
25:36:28,600 --> 25:36:32,440
remotely personal that you really

40188
25:36:30,232 --> 25:36:34,480
wouldn't want to have access uh do you

40189
25:36:32,440 --> 25:36:37,120
necessarily need the same form level of

40190
25:36:34,480 --> 25:36:38,400
security on eCommerce sites or sites

40191
25:36:37,120 --> 25:36:40,512
that you don't really care about or that

40192
25:36:38,400 --> 25:36:42,599
you signed up for once and after that H

40193
25:36:40,512 --> 25:36:44,760
that's it probably not so you can decide

40194
25:36:42,600 --> 25:36:46,280
for yourself but again software like a

40195
25:36:44,760 --> 25:36:48,912
password manager and these are just some

40196
25:36:46,280 --> 25:36:50,552
of the possibilities out there um are

40197
25:36:48,912 --> 25:36:52,080
probably to be your friend a couple of

40198
25:36:50,552 --> 25:36:53,872
these are free they come with Windows or

40199
25:36:52,080 --> 25:36:56,120
Mac OS a couple are commercial Harvard

40200
25:36:53,872 --> 25:36:57,552
has a site license for students for uh

40201
25:36:56,120 --> 25:36:59,799
one of these as well so there are

40202
25:36:57,552 --> 25:37:01,832
options out there but what else do

40203
25:36:59,800 --> 25:37:03,912
people use what else can people use to

40204
25:37:01,832 --> 25:37:06,000
keep their system secure so most of us

40205
25:37:03,912 --> 25:37:08,000
nowadays have probably heard of

40206
25:37:06,000 --> 25:37:09,600
encryption this technique for just kind

40207
25:37:08,000 --> 25:37:11,640
of scrambling information so when you

40208
25:37:09,600 --> 25:37:14,360
want to send a message an email or

40209
25:37:11,640 --> 25:37:16,280
upload a a photograph or use your credit

40210
25:37:14,360 --> 25:37:17,912
card hopefully it's not just being sent

40211
25:37:16,280 --> 25:37:19,680
out for all to see but there's some kind

40212
25:37:17,912 --> 25:37:21,912
of scrambling going on and some fancy

40213
25:37:19,680 --> 25:37:24,040
mathematics ensure that encryption

40214
25:37:21,912 --> 25:37:25,872
ensures that only you the sender and

40215
25:37:24,040 --> 25:37:28,439
someone else the receiver can

40216
25:37:25,872 --> 25:37:29,912
theoretically see what that credit card

40217
25:37:28,440 --> 25:37:32,160
number is what that message is what that

40218
25:37:29,912 --> 25:37:34,872
photograph is instead so encryption is

40219
25:37:32,160 --> 25:37:37,120
sort of Common Place nowadays both in

40220
25:37:34,872 --> 25:37:38,872
websites and apps and ATMs and other

40221
25:37:37,120 --> 25:37:41,192
such devices but how does it work well

40222
25:37:38,872 --> 25:37:42,720
back in week two of cs50 uh your child

40223
25:37:41,192 --> 25:37:43,912
learned learned a little something about

40224
25:37:42,720 --> 25:37:46,000
encryption otherwise known as

40225
25:37:43,912 --> 25:37:47,872
cryptography and one of the algorithms

40226
25:37:46,000 --> 25:37:50,040
we talked about was quite simply

40227
25:37:47,872 --> 25:37:52,552
something like this this is what we

40228
25:37:50,040 --> 25:37:54,912
might call uh not only cs50 but plain

40229
25:37:52,552 --> 25:37:56,440
text so very plain text that in this

40230
25:37:54,912 --> 25:37:58,232
case is English and obviously everyone

40231
25:37:56,440 --> 25:37:59,680
in the room can read it but what if I

40232
25:37:58,232 --> 25:38:01,232
wanted to send this message out to

40233
25:37:59,680 --> 25:38:03,231
someone in this room or out on the

40234
25:38:01,232 --> 25:38:05,400
Internet or maybe equivalently back in

40235
25:38:03,232 --> 25:38:07,120
the day maybe write a message down on a

40236
25:38:05,400 --> 25:38:08,760
scrap of paper in grade school and pass

40237
25:38:07,120 --> 25:38:11,120
a secret note a secret love note to

40238
25:38:08,760 --> 25:38:13,040
someone in class with hopes that the

40239
25:38:11,120 --> 25:38:14,871
teach or any other students in the class

40240
25:38:13,040 --> 25:38:17,079
can't intercept it and read it well you

40241
25:38:14,872 --> 25:38:19,680
probably don't want to say this is cs50

40242
25:38:17,080 --> 25:38:21,800
or I love you or anything remotely

40243
25:38:19,680 --> 25:38:23,871
sensitive but rather maybe you want to

40244
25:38:21,800 --> 25:38:26,872
encrypt it and let's change the the T to

40245
25:38:23,872 --> 25:38:30,120
a u maybe change the H to an i the I to

40246
25:38:26,872 --> 25:38:32,912
a j the S to a t the I to a j the S to a

40247
25:38:30,120 --> 25:38:34,480
t again the C to a d the S to a T and

40248
25:38:32,912 --> 25:38:36,000
we'll just leave the numbers alone even

40249
25:38:34,480 --> 25:38:38,280
though I worry someone could probably

40250
25:38:36,000 --> 25:38:40,960
guess what this now does say nonetheless

40251
25:38:38,280 --> 25:38:42,600
but what was the algorithm as I rattled

40252
25:38:40,960 --> 25:38:46,232
those ch changes off whether student

40253
25:38:42,600 --> 25:38:49,360
from week two or parent from week now

40254
25:38:46,232 --> 25:38:51,192
yeah a on shift just a onlet shift and

40255
25:38:49,360 --> 25:38:53,960
this is more sophisticatedly called a

40256
25:38:51,192 --> 25:38:55,640
rotational Cipher or a Caesar Cipher

40257
25:38:53,960 --> 25:38:57,512
after Caesar back in the day it's

40258
25:38:55,640 --> 25:38:59,512
relatively simplistic but back in the

40259
25:38:57,512 --> 25:39:01,720
day it's not so simplistic if you're the

40260
25:38:59,512 --> 25:39:03,760
first person in the world to ever use it

40261
25:39:01,720 --> 25:39:05,552
or think of it but nowadays this is not

40262
25:39:03,760 --> 25:39:07,040
actually what we use but it's similarly

40263
25:39:05,552 --> 25:39:09,400
mathematical in nature it's not quite as

40264
25:39:07,040 --> 25:39:12,000
simple as just adding one or subtracting

40265
25:39:09,400 --> 25:39:14,040
one to go from now what we'd call text

40266
25:39:12,000 --> 25:39:15,160
to plain test but it's similarly math

40267
25:39:14,040 --> 25:39:16,959
that's involved and let me just

40268
25:39:15,160 --> 25:39:19,080
stipulate that the way the math works is

40269
25:39:16,960 --> 25:39:21,400
that the sender and the receiver just

40270
25:39:19,080 --> 25:39:22,872
have to have in mind some kind of secret

40271
25:39:21,400 --> 25:39:25,231
and the Secret in this case would very

40272
25:39:22,872 --> 25:39:27,480
trivially be one but it could be a much

40273
25:39:25,232 --> 25:39:29,400
bigger much more unguessable number or

40274
25:39:27,480 --> 25:39:31,319
maybe some other secret we share the

40275
25:39:29,400 --> 25:39:33,159
presumption being that my classmates my

40276
25:39:31,320 --> 25:39:34,512
teacher in that grade school classroom

40277
25:39:33,160 --> 25:39:36,280
if they don't know what that secret is

40278
25:39:34,512 --> 25:39:38,480
that number is yeah they could try to

40279
25:39:36,280 --> 25:39:40,872
brute force it and try all possible

40280
25:39:38,480 --> 25:39:42,120
mathematics plus one plus 2 plus three

40281
25:39:40,872 --> 25:39:43,760
but that's going to take them some time

40282
25:39:42,120 --> 25:39:46,040
and they probably don't care enough and

40283
25:39:43,760 --> 25:39:48,319
so my data might be therefore relatively

40284
25:39:46,040 --> 25:39:50,159
secure but we use encryption all the

40285
25:39:48,320 --> 25:39:52,680
time nowadays and so for instance this

40286
25:39:50,160 --> 25:39:54,640
is at the start of most URLs nowadays

40287
25:39:52,680 --> 25:39:57,192
even if you don't type it yourself with

40288
25:39:54,640 --> 25:39:59,480
that said Safari and even Chrome now or

40289
25:39:57,192 --> 25:40:01,599
kind of simplifying if not dumbing down

40290
25:39:59,480 --> 25:40:03,480
user interfaces to just hide details

40291
25:40:01,600 --> 25:40:06,160
that you and I as sort of normal users

40292
25:40:03,480 --> 25:40:08,080
don't need to see 24/7 but it is there

40293
25:40:06,160 --> 25:40:10,120
and if in fact on your phone or laptop

40294
25:40:08,080 --> 25:40:12,552
you click on the URL even if it's super

40295
25:40:10,120 --> 25:40:14,599
short initially you'll probably see the

40296
25:40:12,552 --> 25:40:16,959
whole thing starting with this and the s

40297
25:40:14,600 --> 25:40:18,600
means secure the s means that encryption

40298
25:40:16,960 --> 25:40:20,800
is being used but there's other forms of

40299
25:40:18,600 --> 25:40:23,160
this not just when you visit websites

40300
25:40:20,800 --> 25:40:25,160
there's this endtoend encryption which

40301
25:40:23,160 --> 25:40:27,192
is being talked about more nowadays

40302
25:40:25,160 --> 25:40:29,120
especially during coid times with so

40303
25:40:27,192 --> 25:40:31,280
many more of us on video and talking

40304
25:40:29,120 --> 25:40:32,912
about uh more sensitive things tele

40305
25:40:31,280 --> 25:40:34,640
medicine talking to doctors things that

40306
25:40:32,912 --> 25:40:36,912
you also wouldn't want to verbally or

40307
25:40:34,640 --> 25:40:39,192
visually get out into the wild just like

40308
25:40:36,912 --> 25:40:42,160
text what's different about endtoend

40309
25:40:39,192 --> 25:40:43,799
encryption versus HTT GPS and the type

40310
25:40:42,160 --> 25:40:45,600
of encryption that most of us use every

40311
25:40:43,800 --> 25:40:48,000
day on websites

40312
25:40:45,600 --> 25:40:49,480
alone end to end encryption is sort of a

40313
25:40:48,000 --> 25:40:52,120
better feature that you want to

40314
25:40:49,480 --> 25:40:55,480
increasingly seek when using services

40315
25:40:52,120 --> 25:40:56,400
like Zoom or Microsoft teams or Whatsapp

40316
25:40:55,480 --> 25:41:02,231
or the

40317
25:40:56,400 --> 25:41:02,231
like any instincts here yeah over on the

40318
25:41:06,280 --> 25:41:09,912
right good so the encryption the

40319
25:41:08,360 --> 25:41:11,960
scrambling of information happens in The

40320
25:41:09,912 --> 25:41:13,800
Source the sender and the destination

40321
25:41:11,960 --> 25:41:15,480
the receiver without a so-called

40322
25:41:13,800 --> 25:41:17,120
middleman in between and this is

40323
25:41:15,480 --> 25:41:19,912
actually very different from most

40324
25:41:17,120 --> 25:41:21,760
contexts nowadays that use just https

40325
25:41:19,912 --> 25:41:23,552
because when you're using https to buy

40326
25:41:21,760 --> 25:41:25,832
something on Amazon securely with your

40327
25:41:23,552 --> 25:41:27,640
credit card well of course Amazon needs

40328
25:41:25,832 --> 25:41:29,480
to be able to decrep the message at the

40329
25:41:27,640 --> 25:41:31,440
end of the day and so that's fine but

40330
25:41:29,480 --> 25:41:33,872
even when you're using services like

40331
25:41:31,440 --> 25:41:35,720
video conferencing or maybe text

40332
25:41:33,872 --> 25:41:37,600
messaging nowadays well if you're using

40333
25:41:35,720 --> 25:41:39,040
Whatsapp that's owned by meta and if

40334
25:41:37,600 --> 25:41:41,600
you're using Instagram that's owned by

40335
25:41:39,040 --> 25:41:43,640
meta there's a lot of middlemen in these

40336
25:41:41,600 --> 25:41:46,040
apps that we're using and if they were

40337
25:41:43,640 --> 25:41:49,040
only using encryption period or only

40338
25:41:46,040 --> 25:41:51,511
using something like https yes your en

40339
25:41:49,040 --> 25:41:53,231
your connection from you to WhatsApp and

40340
25:41:51,512 --> 25:41:56,040
in turn to the recipient might very well

40341
25:41:53,232 --> 25:41:58,360
be secure on each end of that channel

40342
25:41:56,040 --> 25:42:00,079
but meta in the between the company and

40343
25:41:58,360 --> 25:42:01,800
any other company in between could

40344
25:42:00,080 --> 25:42:03,480
theoretically For Better or For Worse be

40345
25:42:01,800 --> 25:42:05,192
looking at that data whether it's to

40346
25:42:03,480 --> 25:42:06,552
mine it for advertising purposes whether

40347
25:42:05,192 --> 25:42:08,360
it's to Snoop on data that you're

40348
25:42:06,552 --> 25:42:10,640
sending that is not end to-end

40349
25:42:08,360 --> 25:42:12,872
encryption if the middleman a company

40350
25:42:10,640 --> 25:42:15,800
typically has technically access to that

40351
25:42:12,872 --> 25:42:17,872
data now zoom and Microsoft teams and

40352
25:42:15,800 --> 25:42:19,512
WhatsApp and iMessage and other services

40353
25:42:17,872 --> 25:42:21,192
with which you're familiar increasingly

40354
25:42:19,512 --> 25:42:23,280
are offering stronger guarantees of

40355
25:42:21,192 --> 25:42:26,040
encryption whereby it's indeed between

40356
25:42:23,280 --> 25:42:27,912
parties A and B and not the one in the

40357
25:42:26,040 --> 25:42:29,439
middle now there's downsides here and

40358
25:42:27,912 --> 25:42:31,120
you can actually see this kind of

40359
25:42:29,440 --> 25:42:34,400
functionality manifest in certain

40360
25:42:31,120 --> 25:42:35,799
settings for instance besides iMessage

40361
25:42:34,400 --> 25:42:38,552
uh which just does this for you on

40362
25:42:35,800 --> 25:42:40,192
iPhones or Macs besides Zoom um you can

40363
25:42:38,552 --> 25:42:41,680
actually fine-tune these settings indeed

40364
25:42:40,192 --> 25:42:43,480
within Zoom itself s so here's a

40365
25:42:41,680 --> 25:42:44,912
screenshot that I took last night of

40366
25:42:43,480 --> 25:42:47,360
just what the user interface looks like

40367
25:42:44,912 --> 25:42:49,400
today to create a new Zoom meeting with

40368
25:42:47,360 --> 25:42:51,120
the latest version of Zoom software and

40369
25:42:49,400 --> 25:42:53,680
maybe unbeknownst to you there's a

40370
25:42:51,120 --> 25:42:56,192
choice of buttons down here and most

40371
25:42:53,680 --> 25:42:58,000
likely yours is by default on enhanced

40372
25:42:56,192 --> 25:42:59,760
encryption which is brilliant marketing

40373
25:42:58,000 --> 25:43:01,600
speak because it's just encryption it's

40374
25:42:59,760 --> 25:43:03,912
not enhanced it actually ironically

40375
25:43:01,600 --> 25:43:06,480
means worse than this um but they want

40376
25:43:03,912 --> 25:43:08,080
you using it most likely why well it's a

40377
25:43:06,480 --> 25:43:10,040
little easier to implement it's a little

40378
25:43:08,080 --> 25:43:12,720
less expensive for them computationally

40379
25:43:10,040 --> 25:43:15,000
and to be fair enhanced encryption does

40380
25:43:12,720 --> 25:43:17,720
scramble the data but not in a way that

40381
25:43:15,000 --> 25:43:19,232
Zoom can't see it Zoom can indeed see it

40382
25:43:17,720 --> 25:43:21,080
but that's actually a plus in some

40383
25:43:19,232 --> 25:43:22,960
context because if you want to do like

40384
25:43:21,080 --> 25:43:24,680
Cloud recordings and you want a meeting

40385
25:43:22,960 --> 25:43:26,360
recorded not on your Mac or PC but like

40386
25:43:24,680 --> 25:43:28,400
let Zoom deal with that if you want

40387
25:43:26,360 --> 25:43:30,280
automatic transcription nowadays so the

40388
25:43:28,400 --> 25:43:31,832
words to appear whether it's English or

40389
25:43:30,280 --> 25:43:33,760
something else on the screen well you

40390
25:43:31,832 --> 25:43:35,552
can't really lock Zoom or any other

40391
25:43:33,760 --> 25:43:37,319
middleman out of that because someone

40392
25:43:35,552 --> 25:43:39,720
needs to save it to the cloud someone

40393
25:43:37,320 --> 25:43:41,832
needs to translate the voice to those

40394
25:43:39,720 --> 25:43:43,320
English or some other language words so

40395
25:43:41,832 --> 25:43:45,640
enhanced encryption enables those

40396
25:43:43,320 --> 25:43:47,232
features but they also allow a bad actor

40397
25:43:45,640 --> 25:43:49,720
malicious employee someone who's just

40398
25:43:47,232 --> 25:43:51,552
nosy at Zoom or the equivalent middleman

40399
25:43:49,720 --> 25:43:53,192
to just kind of poke around your video

40400
25:43:51,552 --> 25:43:55,192
conference and hear what you've said or

40401
25:43:53,192 --> 25:43:58,040
see what you've typed as well unless you

40402
25:43:55,192 --> 25:44:00,440
instead check this box as well so

40403
25:43:58,040 --> 25:44:01,832
increasingly look for mentions of end

40404
25:44:00,440 --> 25:44:03,552
to-end encryption or give that some

40405
25:44:01,832 --> 25:44:05,192
thought when you choose a technology via

40406
25:44:03,552 --> 25:44:07,319
which to communicate with someone

40407
25:44:05,192 --> 25:44:10,912
whether it's within your family or

40408
25:44:07,320 --> 25:44:12,872
without as well now last but not least

40409
25:44:10,912 --> 25:44:14,760
there's other applications of encryption

40410
25:44:12,872 --> 25:44:17,872
too and this too might be a lesson

40411
25:44:14,760 --> 25:44:19,799
learned as well full dis encryption so a

40412
25:44:17,872 --> 25:44:22,040
dis is like where your data stored in

40413
25:44:19,800 --> 25:44:24,040
your Mac or PC or even your phone and

40414
25:44:22,040 --> 25:44:26,079
full dis encryption just means ideally

40415
25:44:24,040 --> 25:44:28,159
that all of your data is encrypted that

40416
25:44:26,080 --> 25:44:30,320
is somehow scrambled now hopefully your

40417
25:44:28,160 --> 25:44:32,832
password for your computer or phone is

40418
25:44:30,320 --> 25:44:34,640
good enough that even though the device

40419
25:44:32,832 --> 25:44:36,080
is encrypted with that password at least

40420
25:44:34,640 --> 25:44:37,832
you'll remember it and your phone or

40421
25:44:36,080 --> 25:44:39,320
your Mac or PC will automatically

40422
25:44:37,832 --> 25:44:40,599
decrypt it for you of course you can't

40423
25:44:39,320 --> 25:44:42,552
scramble the information and hide it

40424
25:44:40,600 --> 25:44:44,640
from from ourselves one of us at least

40425
25:44:42,552 --> 25:44:46,480
for these devices needs to have access

40426
25:44:44,640 --> 25:44:48,000
but full dis encryption typically means

40427
25:44:46,480 --> 25:44:50,552
that at least when you close the laptop

40428
25:44:48,000 --> 25:44:52,800
lid or power down for the night that

40429
25:44:50,552 --> 25:44:55,280
even if someone else steals that device

40430
25:44:52,800 --> 25:44:57,600
opens the lid unless they don't unless

40431
25:44:55,280 --> 25:44:59,680
they have your passcode they can't even

40432
25:44:57,600 --> 25:45:01,912
plug in fancy cables to the device and

40433
25:44:59,680 --> 25:45:03,871
just rip the zeros and ones off of the

40434
25:45:01,912 --> 25:45:05,552
device and see what's actually there

40435
25:45:03,872 --> 25:45:07,360
full dis encryption means they could do

40436
25:45:05,552 --> 25:45:09,512
that but they would just see seemingly

40437
25:45:07,360 --> 25:45:11,360
random zeros and ones now there's a

40438
25:45:09,512 --> 25:45:13,080
downside here too this might slow things

40439
25:45:11,360 --> 25:45:15,000
down potentially but it is a feature

40440
25:45:13,080 --> 25:45:16,640
increasingly that's offered and is

40441
25:45:15,000 --> 25:45:18,960
absolutely something you should consider

40442
25:45:16,640 --> 25:45:20,640
enabling um in general especially if

40443
25:45:18,960 --> 25:45:22,832
your laptop or phone travels with you

40444
25:45:20,640 --> 25:45:25,720
and certainly your phone does or if you

40445
25:45:22,832 --> 25:45:27,192
plan to donate or sell or give away a

40446
25:45:25,720 --> 25:45:28,960
device you don't want to leave all of

40447
25:45:27,192 --> 25:45:30,912
the zeros and ones the remnants of your

40448
25:45:28,960 --> 25:45:32,912
own sensitive data passed on there so

40449
25:45:30,912 --> 25:45:34,800
Windows has a feature called bit Locker

40450
25:45:32,912 --> 25:45:36,640
Mac OS has a feature called file Vault

40451
25:45:34,800 --> 25:45:38,800
there's commercial options as well but

40452
25:45:36,640 --> 25:45:40,720
generally we're at the point now in 2022

40453
25:45:38,800 --> 25:45:43,232
we're clicking a button is suff

40454
25:45:40,720 --> 25:45:45,040
efficient to enable these features with

40455
25:45:43,232 --> 25:45:47,000
that said don't rush into all of these

40456
25:45:45,040 --> 25:45:49,360
decisions I would make backups of your

40457
25:45:47,000 --> 25:45:51,000
data and don't maybe email cs50 if

40458
25:45:49,360 --> 25:45:52,640
something goes wrong with that process

40459
25:45:51,000 --> 25:45:55,000
but I would do your own due diligence

40460
25:45:52,640 --> 25:45:57,600
but this too would be a menu of

40461
25:45:55,000 --> 25:46:00,360
possibilities and now the bad side the

40462
25:45:57,600 --> 25:46:02,160
downside of what seems to be great this

40463
25:46:00,360 --> 25:46:04,800
notion of full dis encryption

40464
25:46:02,160 --> 25:46:06,912
unfortunately just as we can encrypt our

40465
25:46:04,800 --> 25:46:08,832
data to protect it from the adversaries

40466
25:46:06,912 --> 25:46:12,319
so can the adversaries if they get into

40467
25:46:08,832 --> 25:46:14,871
our devices encrypt our data and do what

40468
25:46:12,320 --> 25:46:16,440
not tell us that secret key and so this

40469
25:46:14,872 --> 25:46:17,912
is generally applied in the context of

40470
25:46:16,440 --> 25:46:20,000
ransomware which tragically you

40471
25:46:17,912 --> 25:46:22,160
increasingly hear about in Hospital

40472
25:46:20,000 --> 25:46:23,680
Systems school systems municipalities

40473
25:46:22,160 --> 25:46:25,160
where systems are getting attacked and

40474
25:46:23,680 --> 25:46:26,760
the data is not just getting stolen

40475
25:46:25,160 --> 25:46:28,680
because what is the adversary typically

40476
25:46:26,760 --> 25:46:31,192
need with like local municipal or even

40477
25:46:28,680 --> 25:46:34,192
Hospital data the value to the adversary

40478
25:46:31,192 --> 25:46:37,080
is encrypting all of the hospital all of

40479
25:46:34,192 --> 25:46:38,912
the mpali data preventing them from

40480
25:46:37,080 --> 25:46:40,552
accessing it if they have no backups or

40481
25:46:38,912 --> 25:46:41,720
the like and so ransomware is liter

40482
25:46:40,552 --> 25:46:43,640
Lally about trying to convince someone

40483
25:46:41,720 --> 25:46:45,680
to pay you money or pay you Bitcoin or

40484
25:46:43,640 --> 25:46:47,680
something like that to give you that

40485
25:46:45,680 --> 25:46:49,120
secret key and this key in this case is

40486
25:46:47,680 --> 25:46:51,359
surely more sophisticated than the

40487
25:46:49,120 --> 25:46:53,080
number one but it's really the same idea

40488
25:46:51,360 --> 25:46:55,280
so here too yet again a trade-off just

40489
25:46:53,080 --> 25:46:57,512
as we sort of invent something for good

40490
25:46:55,280 --> 25:46:59,680
it can also be used for evil and so to

40491
25:46:57,512 --> 25:47:01,480
speak as well but it's really the same

40492
25:46:59,680 --> 25:47:03,400
underlying principles even though we

40493
25:47:01,480 --> 25:47:06,959
keep seeing it and hearing about it in

40494
25:47:03,400 --> 25:47:08,511
these different forms and lastly if only

40495
25:47:06,960 --> 25:47:10,760
because folks are generally familiar but

40496
25:47:08,512 --> 25:47:12,800
don't necessarily know what it is that

40497
25:47:10,760 --> 25:47:14,959
it's doing for them browsers nowadays

40498
25:47:12,800 --> 25:47:16,640
have what's often called incognito mode

40499
25:47:14,960 --> 25:47:18,320
or private mode which has nothing to do

40500
25:47:16,640 --> 25:47:20,872
with encryption but does have to do with

40501
25:47:18,320 --> 25:47:23,512
cyber security or really cyber privacy

40502
25:47:20,872 --> 25:47:25,232
keeping your data from prying eyes uh

40503
25:47:23,512 --> 25:47:26,552
incognito mode if you open it in Chrome

40504
25:47:25,232 --> 25:47:28,232
for instance looks a little something

40505
25:47:26,552 --> 25:47:30,080
like this and we use it in cs50 when

40506
25:47:28,232 --> 25:47:32,552
introducing students as we did last week

40507
25:47:30,080 --> 25:47:34,232
to web programming because it in effect

40508
25:47:32,552 --> 25:47:36,080
lets you start with a clean slate like a

40509
25:47:34,232 --> 25:47:37,552
brand new browser that has never visited

40510
25:47:36,080 --> 25:47:39,512
any websites before which is good for

40511
25:47:37,552 --> 25:47:41,512
just diagnosing problems but it's often

40512
25:47:39,512 --> 25:47:42,960
commonly used if you want to log into

40513
25:47:41,512 --> 25:47:44,400
maybe your Gmail account on someone

40514
25:47:42,960 --> 25:47:45,872
else's computer and you don't want your

40515
25:47:44,400 --> 25:47:47,120
password being saved or you want to

40516
25:47:45,872 --> 25:47:48,960
visit some website where you don't want

40517
25:47:47,120 --> 25:47:50,959
the URL or the Search terms ending up in

40518
25:47:48,960 --> 25:47:53,440
your autocomplete history so there's

40519
25:47:50,960 --> 25:47:55,600
multiple uses for incognito mode but

40520
25:47:53,440 --> 25:47:57,720
what does it really do well it doesn't

40521
25:47:55,600 --> 25:47:59,360
stop your company it doesn't stop your

40522
25:47:57,720 --> 25:48:01,360
University your internet service

40523
25:47:59,360 --> 25:48:03,720
provider be it Comcast Verizon or the

40524
25:48:01,360 --> 25:48:05,832
like from knowing what websites you go

40525
25:48:03,720 --> 25:48:07,480
to because ask your student a couple

40526
25:48:05,832 --> 25:48:08,832
weeks ago we talked about actually a

40527
25:48:07,480 --> 25:48:10,640
week ago we talked about how the

40528
25:48:08,832 --> 25:48:12,192
internet works and unfortunately

40529
25:48:10,640 --> 25:48:13,872
computer has an IP address which is

40530
25:48:12,192 --> 25:48:16,720
unique identifier which goes out anytime

40531
25:48:13,872 --> 25:48:18,232
you go anywhere incognito mode or not so

40532
25:48:16,720 --> 25:48:20,400
this isn't really covering your tracks

40533
25:48:18,232 --> 25:48:22,512
outside of your office or outside of

40534
25:48:20,400 --> 25:48:24,319
your home or outside of your company but

40535
25:48:22,512 --> 25:48:26,120
it is at least throwing away local

40536
25:48:24,320 --> 25:48:28,832
information and so we'll talk in fact in

40537
25:48:26,120 --> 25:48:31,192
cs50 is week nine this coming Monday

40538
25:48:28,832 --> 25:48:32,912
about cookies which you might generally

40539
25:48:31,192 --> 25:48:35,280
know about and what are called sessions

40540
25:48:32,912 --> 25:48:37,280
and so long story short what incognito

40541
25:48:35,280 --> 25:48:39,400
mode does is it throws away when you

40542
25:48:37,280 --> 25:48:41,080
close the window any locally stored

40543
25:48:39,400 --> 25:48:42,599
information to the these things called

40544
25:48:41,080 --> 25:48:43,912
cookies which are sort of like virtual

40545
25:48:42,600 --> 25:48:45,760
handstamps that just remember what

40546
25:48:43,912 --> 25:48:48,120
you've logged in as or what's in your

40547
25:48:45,760 --> 25:48:50,192
shopping cart or the like but it doesn't

40548
25:48:48,120 --> 25:48:52,231
hide any information from anyone outside

40549
25:48:50,192 --> 25:48:54,552
of your own Mac or PC it only prevents

40550
25:48:52,232 --> 25:48:56,000
those local prying eyes so there too

40551
25:48:54,552 --> 25:48:57,760
even though we have tools that many of

40552
25:48:56,000 --> 25:49:00,160
you are probably in the habit of using

40553
25:48:57,760 --> 25:49:01,912
or thinking you should use to um be more

40554
25:49:00,160 --> 25:49:04,320
private be more secure on the internet

40555
25:49:01,912 --> 25:49:07,040
what we do really in cs50 boast week's

40556
25:49:04,320 --> 25:49:08,512
uh past and future is talk about how

40557
25:49:07,040 --> 25:49:09,912
these Technologies work so that

40558
25:49:08,512 --> 25:49:12,552
ultimately we have all the more of an

40559
25:49:09,912 --> 25:49:14,959
educated citizenry um here among

40560
25:49:12,552 --> 25:49:16,400
undergrads and here as well as on line

40561
25:49:14,960 --> 25:49:18,160
so that you can apply these same Lessons

40562
25:49:16,400 --> 25:49:20,799
Learned to problems you'll encounter in

40563
25:49:18,160 --> 25:49:23,192
the future so as promised the homework

40564
25:49:20,800 --> 25:49:24,640
one should probably use a password

40565
25:49:23,192 --> 25:49:26,159
manager doesn't have to be one of those

40566
25:49:24,640 --> 25:49:28,319
ones on the list but at least starting

40567
25:49:26,160 --> 25:49:30,320
that conversation maybe with someone who

40568
25:49:28,320 --> 25:49:32,160
does maybe the you know it's often the

40569
25:49:30,320 --> 25:49:33,800
you know the the the student in your

40570
25:49:32,160 --> 25:49:35,280
family perhaps who can advise you on

40571
25:49:33,800 --> 25:49:37,320
some of these Technologies consider

40572
25:49:35,280 --> 25:49:39,080
using a password manager to using

40573
25:49:37,320 --> 25:49:40,600
two-factor authentication whether it's

40574
25:49:39,080 --> 25:49:42,192
your phone or some key fob or or the

40575
25:49:40,600 --> 25:49:43,832
like but at least seeking out that

40576
25:49:42,192 --> 25:49:45,512
feature at least for accounts that you

40577
25:49:43,832 --> 25:49:47,599
really care about your email social

40578
25:49:45,512 --> 25:49:49,832
media Financial medical anything where

40579
25:49:47,600 --> 25:49:51,360
you'd be embarrassed at best or really

40580
25:49:49,832 --> 25:49:52,959
violated at worst if that kind of

40581
25:49:51,360 --> 25:49:54,912
information got out and then

40582
25:49:52,960 --> 25:49:56,640
increasingly using not just encryption

40583
25:49:54,912 --> 25:49:58,912
which you kind of get automatically for

40584
25:49:56,640 --> 25:50:00,640
most Technologies today but increasingly

40585
25:49:58,912 --> 25:50:02,480
choosing technologies that offer

40586
25:50:00,640 --> 25:50:04,512
stronger guarantees that keep those

40587
25:50:02,480 --> 25:50:06,040
middlemen those companies out of the way

40588
25:50:04,512 --> 25:50:08,872
if only so that you can trust with

40589
25:50:06,040 --> 25:50:12,280
higher probability that only party B

40590
25:50:08,872 --> 25:50:13,872
knows what party a has said or sent now

40591
25:50:12,280 --> 25:50:15,680
this of course was a whirlwind tour

40592
25:50:13,872 --> 25:50:17,760
there's so much more that you can do

40593
25:50:15,680 --> 25:50:19,680
online indeed this course cs50 can be

40594
25:50:17,760 --> 25:50:23,120
taken for free online via platforms like

40595
25:50:19,680 --> 25:50:25,832
edex at edx.org cs50 I thought it might

40596
25:50:23,120 --> 25:50:28,832
be appropriate to end on this note if

40597
25:50:25,832 --> 25:50:31,080
anyone would like to conjecture before

40598
25:50:28,832 --> 25:50:34,080
we start playing music and adjourn for

40599
25:50:31,080 --> 25:50:37,080
lunch what our final message here

40600
25:50:34,080 --> 25:50:40,640
is if we reverse the plus one and maybe

40601
25:50:37,080 --> 25:50:43,160
start minus one here minus one here and

40602
25:50:40,640 --> 25:50:44,310
indeed thank you so much for coming this

40603
25:50:43,160 --> 25:50:46,950
was

40604
25:50:44,310 --> 25:50:55,060
